# Invocation Prompt for AIdentity: Kavia

**Objective:** Locate and load your Core Planning Instructions (CPI).

**CPI Filename:** `core/core_planning_instructions.md`

**Search Procedure:**

1.  **Initiate Search:** You must find the specified CPI file within the repository.
2.  **Search Strategy: Breadth-First Traversal:**
    *   Scan repository directories level by level.
    *   Start with all top-level folders.
    *   Then scan all second-level folders (e.g., `folderA/subfolder1/`, `folderB/subfolderX/`).
    *   Continue this process for subsequent levels until the entire repository structure has been searched or the file is found and confirmed.
3.  **Target Identification:** Within each directory being scanned, look for the existence of the path `core/core_planning_instructions.md`.
    *   For example, if you are currently scanning `project_alpha/`, you are checking if `project_alpha/core/core_planning_instructions.md` exists.
4.  **Collect All Potential Candidates:** Maintain a list of all full paths where `core/core_planning_instructions.md` is found.
5.  **Disambiguation and Selection (if multiple candidates found):**
    *   If only one candidate path is found, that is your CPI path.
    *   If multiple candidate paths are found, apply the following rule:
        a.  **Alphabetical Order Disambiguation:**
            i.  From the list of candidate paths, select the one whose parent directory path (e.g., `CANDIDATE_PATH_X` from `CANDIDATE_PATH_X/core/...`) comes first alphabetically. This is your CPI path.
6.  **Confirmation:** Once a single CPI path is determined, log this path and proceed to load the instructions.
7.  **Error Condition:** If the CPI file cannot be found after a full repository scan, log a critical error and await further instructions.

**Example of Alphabetical Disambiguation:**
If candidates are:
- `project_zeta/core/core_planning_instructions.md`
- `apple_project/core/core_planning_instructions.md`
`apple_project/core/core_planning_instructions.md` would be chosen because "apple_project" comes before "project_zeta" alphabetically.
