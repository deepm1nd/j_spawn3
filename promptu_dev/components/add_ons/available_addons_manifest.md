# Available Prompt Add-ons

To use an add-on, include its **app name (which is its folder name)** in the `[[USER_ADDON_SELECTION]]` block of your `post_promptu.txt` file. Add-on "apps" are subdirectories located within the `promptu/components/add_ons/` directory. The Planning AI, guided by `core_planning_instructions.txt`, will then read the primary instruction file for a selected add-on from `promptu/components/add_ons/[addon_app_name]/[addon_app_name].txt`. Each add-on app folder may also contain other supporting files or sub-frameworks for that specific add-on.

- **`task_resumption_addon` [DEPRECATED]** (Add-on App) - **Note:** Superseded by the new integrated component handoff note system defined in `core_planning_instructions.txt` (Section IV.F.5 and IV.B.16).
    - **Type:** Inheritable Utility
    - **Description:** This add-on app (primary instruction file: `task_resumption_addon/task_resumption_addon.txt`) instructs Task AIs to create and maintain a resumable prompt for their current task. This helps in continuing work seamlessly if a task is interrupted.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** Typically appended to task prompts generated by a primary orchestration add-on (like `dev_planner`) to enhance Task AI robustness.
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Designed to be inherited by Task AIs.

- **`dev_planner`** (Add-on App)
    - **Type:** Primary Orchestration Add-on
    - **Description:** This add-on app (formerly `task_spawning_addon`; primary instruction file: `dev_planner/dev_planner.txt`) enables core project planning, research integration, and task generation functionality. When selected, the Planning AI (running `dev_planner`) can perform initial research, generate a main development plan, a Task Launch Plan (`00_task_launch_plan.md`), and individual task prompt files for subsequent Task AIs (which can be planning or developer AIs based on the selected workflow). It is configurable via its `USER_dev_planner_CONFIG.txt` file (located in `promptu/components/add_ons/dev_planner/`) and its parameters can be overridden by a `[[USER_CONFIG_FOR_dev_planner]]` block in the user's `post_promptu.txt` file.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** Essential for using the Promptu framework to break down a user's project request into a structured, phased plan with detailed, executable tasks. This is the primary add-on for project decomposition, research integration, and multi-task/multi-AI coordination. Supports multiple workflows like Monolithic, DelegatedPlanning, and HybridIterative.
    - **Key Parameters (defined in `USER_dev_planner_CONFIG.txt`):**
        - `PROJECT_NAME` (Optional): Name of the overall project.
        - `ITERATION_ID` (Optional): Identifier for the current iteration.
        - `WORKFLOW_TYPE` (Optional): Specifies workflow ("Monolithic", "DelegatedPlanning", "HybridIterative"). Default: "Monolithic".
        - `BASE_OUTPUT_PATH` (Required): Base directory for all outputs.
        - `MAIN_DEV_PLAN_FILENAME` (Required): Filename for the main plan document.
        - `TASK_PROMPTS_SUBDIR` (Required): Subdirectory for TLP and task prompts.
        - `SUBMODULE_PLANS_SUBDIR` (Required): Subdirectory for sub-plans and next_steps docs from Task AIs.
        - `TASK_ARTIFACTS_SUBDIR` (Required): Subdirectory for deliverables from Task AIs.
    - **Key Outputs:** `[MAIN_DEV_PLAN_FILENAME]`, `00_task_launch_plan.md`, multiple `p<Phase>_t<Task>_*.txt` task prompts. Output locations are determined by resolved parameters. Research artifacts are stored in the KB.
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Works in conjunction with `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt`. Other selected add-on apps (like `task_resumption_addon`, `create_research_report`) can have their content appended to task prompts generated by this add-on; the `dev_planner` app's own primary instruction content is not appended.

- **`create_research_report`** (Add-on App)
    - **Type:** Primary Process Add-on
    - **Description:** This add-on app (primary instruction file: `create_research_report/create_research_report.txt`) guides the AI in generating a research report based on provided inputs. It involves parsing user configurations, ingesting and validating input documents and web links, performing research (including following references to a specified depth), iteratively generating content based on desired output depth, and finally assembling the report.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** To automate or assist in the creation of research reports. It can be used to synthesize information from various sources, follow research trails, and produce structured outputs from outlines to detailed reports with AI-generated insights.
    - **Key Inputs (from `user_create_research_report_config.txt` located in `promptu/components/add_ons/create_research_report/`):**
        - `PROPOSED_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS` (Optional)
        - `GUIDELINES_DOC_PATHS` (Optional)
        - `ADDITIONAL_WEB_LINKS_FILE` (Optional)
        - `EXEMPLAR_DOCS` (Optional)
        - `GENERAL_INPUT_DOCS` (Required)
        - `PRIMARY_INPUT_DOC_PATH` (Required)
        - `ITERATIVE_OUTPUT_DEPTH` (Required, 0-3)
        - `REFERENCE_FOLLOWING_DEPTH` (Required, 0-2)
    - **Key Outputs:** Generic research reports. The specific names and structure will depend on the inputs and the execution of the add-on's logic. Output location is typically determined by its own configuration parameters or general path configurations if not overridden.
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Designed to be used as a primary add-on. Relies on its specific `user_create_research_report_config.txt` file for configuration. If selected alongside other primary add-ons like `dev_planner`, the user's overarching request in `post_promptu.txt` must clearly direct which process is primary.
