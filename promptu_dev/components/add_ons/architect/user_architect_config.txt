# === Output Configuration ===
# Requirement: Required | DefaultType: Placeholder
# Description: User-defined base directory for all outputs from this specific invocation of the architect add-on (e.g., outputs/MyProject/Architecture_Run01/). This path should be relative to the repository root or absolute. Note: To ensure shared KB outputs from research tasks (configured by `architect` using relative paths like `../../kb/`) are placed correctly in the mode-appropriate top-level 'kb' folder (e.g., `promptu/kb/` or `promptu_dev/kb/`), this `BASE_OUTPUT_PATH` should be structured accordingly (e.g., `promptu/my_project_outputs/run1/` or `promptu_dev/my_project_outputs/run1/`).
# Default: outputs/default_architect_run/
BASE_OUTPUT_PATH: [USER_VALUE_START] outputs/default_architect_run/ [USER_VALUE_END]

# Requirement: Required | DefaultType: Accepted
# Description: "Filename for the primary architectural specification document being generated by this component. This document will be created under BASE_OUTPUT_PATH."
# Default: main_architectural_specification.md
MAIN_ARCH_SPEC_FILENAME: [USER_VALUE_START] main_architectural_specification.md [USER_VALUE_END]

# Requirement: Optional | DefaultType: Accepted
# Description: "Filename for the document that will capture the final architectural selections made during a review phase (e.g., Phase 2 of SpecWalker). Created under BASE_OUTPUT_PATH."
# Default: architectural_selections.md
OUTPUT_ARCH_SELECTIONS_FILENAME: [USER_VALUE_START] architectural_selections.md [USER_VALUE_END]

# Requirement: Required | DefaultType: Accepted
# Description: Subdirectory name (relative to BASE_OUTPUT_PATH) where supporting documents like glossaries, context maps, or detailed diagrams will be saved. The IPC directory (ipc/) for related tasks will be created inside this subdirectory.
# Default: supporting_documents
SUPPORTING_DOCS_SUBDIR: [USER_VALUE_START] supporting_documents [USER_VALUE_END]

# Requirement: Required | DefaultType: Accepted
# Description: Subdirectory name (relative to BASE_OUTPUT_PATH) for detailed architectural specification sections or views (e.g., logical_view.md, deployment_view.md) if the specification is broken down.
# Default: detailed_spec_sections
DETAILED_SECTIONS_SUBDIR: [USER_VALUE_START] detailed_spec_sections [USER_VALUE_END]

AUXILIARY_FILES_SUBDIR: [USER_VALUE_START] auxiliary_files [USER_VALUE_END]

# === Operational Parameters ===
# Requirement: Optional | DefaultType: Accepted
# Description: "Specifies the operational workflow for the architect. 'Monolithic' (generates a single, comprehensive architectural specification) is the primary supported mode. Other types are for future extension or specific use cases."
# Default: Monolithic
WORKFLOW_TYPE: [USER_VALUE_START] Monolithic [USER_VALUE_END]

# Requirement: Optional | DefaultType: Placeholder
# Description: OPERATIONAL PARAMETER - Unique instance ID for this execution of architect, typically provided by the invoking Main AI (Agni).
