# Agentiq Feature Roadmap

## Future Enhancements

*   **NLU-Driven Task Routing:** Implement functionality for Agentiq to understand general user requests, determine the appropriate internal task/component, infer or request necessary parameters, and then execute the task. This would allow for more natural and flexible interaction.
*   **Enhanced Chat Behavior for Batch Task Processing & Optimization:** Develop Agentiq's chat behavior to intelligently receive multiple requests or complex multi-step instructions. This includes capabilities to organize these into a logical group of tasks and then execute them efficiently (potentially involving optimized order or parallelization). This feature will impact chat interaction models, task planning, and workflow execution.
*   **(Other items can be added here as we think of them)**
