# Handoff Notes for PromptuDev_AI

**Shorthand Reference:** `SH_JulesContinuum: PromptuDev_AI`
**Instance Role:** Orchestrator for the "Iterative Phased Development Process."
**Project:** DevPlannerTest_WithProposal - Command-line Diary Application (as defined in `post_promptu.txt`).
**Current Overall Goal:** Initiate and manage the "Iterative Phased Development Process."

**Initial State:**
*   This is the first run for this project. No prior phase state exists.
*   **A user plan proposal IS provided via `USER_PLAN_PROPOSAL_PATH`: `inputs/gritos_proposed_plan.md`.**
*   Proceed with "Phase 0: Initialization & Comparative Analysis" as per your main prompt instructions. This will involve `dev_planner` analyzing the user's proposal, `PromptuDev_AI` guiding an independent AI-derived plan outline generation (e.g. by calling `dev_planner` again with a different goal), and then `PromptuDev_AI` facilitating a comparison and decision with the user.

**Key Files:**
*   Main Prompt & Configuration: `promptu_dev/test_prompts/PromptuDev_AI_Test2_WithProposal_post_promptu.txt` (this is your current main directive file)
*   User Guide: `promptu/add_ons/dev_planner/dev_planner_user_guide.md`
*   User Plan Proposal: `inputs/gritos_proposed_plan.md` (ensure you can access and instruct `dev_planner` to use this)
