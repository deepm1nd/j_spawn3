**Session Summary - $(DATE_ISO_8601)**
**Instance:** Agni (PromptuDev_AI)
**Project:** AIdentity Traits System Implementation (Phases 1-4)

**Key Activities & Decisions:**

*   **Phase 1: System-Wide Review, Trait Extraction & Library Creation:**
    *   Reviewed core AI definitions (`core_planning_instructions.txt`, `aidentity_qb.txt`, `aidentity_context.json`) and key components (`dev_planner`, `create_research_report`, `compliance_plm`, `task_resumption_addon`, `agentiq`, `promptimizer`).
    *   Extracted and created a total of 96 individual Trait definition files (`.md` with YAML frontmatter) in `promptu_dev/core/traits/`. This includes:
        *   25 traits from `core_planning_instructions.txt` (Sections IV & V).
        *   15 traits from `core_planning_instructions.txt` (Sections I, II, III).
        *   7 traits from `promptu_dev/aidentity/promptu_qb.txt`.
        *   5 traits from `promptu_dev/aidentity/aidentity_context.json`.
        *   14 traits from `dev_planner.txt`.
        *   11 traits from `create_research_report.txt`.
        *   3 traits from `task_resumption_addon.txt`, `agentiq_manifest.json`, and `promptimizer.txt`.
        *   2 traits from `compliance_plm` (manifest and test_resolver_component).
        *   2 new chat-related traits (`InterpretAsteriskEmphasis`, `DetectPotentialInputGarbageOrTypo`) added by user request during the process.
        *   3 initial example traits created at the start.
    *   Established a flat directory structure for the trait library in `promptu_dev/core/traits/` after an initial attempt at categorized subdirectories proved incompatible with file creation tool behavior. Empty category subdirectories were removed.
    *   Corrected filenames of 3 initial example traits to match their `id` metadata and naming convention (e.g., `Trait_Core_Rule_FileOperationsRestriction.md`).

*   **Phase 2: Manifest System & Core Instruction Refactoring:**
    *   Defined the JSON structure for the Trait Activation Manifest.
    *   Created and iteratively updated `promptu_dev/aidentity/directives/active_manifest.json`. The final version includes 10 traits:
        *   `Trait_Core_Rule_FileOperationsRestriction` (Rule, enabled)
        *   `Trait_Core_Rule_ModificationOfOperationalDirectives` (Rule, enabled)
        *   `Trait_DevPlanner_MandatoryInputConfirmation` (Rule, enabled)
        *   `Trait_Core_Guideline_BranchNamingConventionsForCommits` (Guideline, enabled)
        *   `Trait_Core_Guideline_ActionNoticeProtocol` (Guideline, enabled)
        *   `Trait_Chat_AICommStyleSessionUniqueIDsForActionDrivingQuestions` (Guideline, enabled)
        *   `Trait_Chat_InterpretAsteriskEmphasis` (Preference, enabled)
        *   `Trait_Chat_DetectPotentialInputGarbageOrTypo` (Preference, enabled)
        *   `Trait_Core_Preference_MinimizeChatFrequencyAndContent` (Preference, enabled)
        *   `Trait_Core_Guideline_PrimaryProgrammingLanguageRust` (Guideline, *disabled*)
    *   Refactored `promptu_dev/core/core_planning_instructions.txt`:
        *   Removed hardcoded operational directives and chat behaviors from Sections IV and V.
        *   Integrated new "IV.A Dynamic Trait Loading and Activation Protocol".
        *   Added placeholder for "IV.B Trait Adherence and Enforcement Mechanism".
        *   Added placeholder for "V.A Chat Trait Adherence".
    *   Updated comments in `core_planning_instructions.txt` and prepared a descriptive note for `aidentity_context.json` regarding `active_directives_manifest_path`.

*   **Phase 3: Documentation Update:**
    *   Created `promptu_dev/core/traits/README.md` for the trait library, explaining its purpose, trait file format, and activation via the manifest.
    *   Drafted and finalized a user guide for the Traits system: `promptu_dev/docs/guides/aidentity_traits_usage_guide.md`.
    *   Updated the `traits/README.md` to link to this new user guide.
    *   Drafted and created a developer guide for creating new traits: `promptu_dev/docs/developer_guides/creating_aidentity_traits.md`.

*   **Phase 4: Directive Checking Infrastructure (Design & Initial Chat Implementation):**
    *   Drafted and integrated "IV.B Trait Adherence and Enforcement Mechanism" into `core_planning_instructions.txt`.
    *   Drafted and integrated "V.A Chat Trait Adherence" (covering input and response processing) into `core_planning_instructions.txt`.
    *   Created design documents (saved to `promptu_dev/docs/developer_guides/`) for:
        *   `internal_chat_input_processing_logic.md`
        *   `internal_chat_response_formulation_logic.md`
    *   Conceptually updated AI's internal logic for chat processing to align with these new design documents and trait adherence.
    *   Simulated the 'Dynamic Trait Loading and Activation Protocol' twice: once identifying filename issues with initial traits, and a second time confirming the corrections resolved these issues, resulting in 6 enabled traits from the manifest being loaded correctly.

**Focus for Next Jules Instance (`PromptuDev_AI` Continuum):**
*   No further pending tasks assigned from the "AIdentity Traits System Implementation (Phases 1-4)" objective.
*   The system is now architecturally prepared for Phase 5: Iterative Implementation (of trait adherence for more action types beyond chat), Testing & Refinement, which would involve engineering changes to the AI's core operational code.
*   Awaiting new user direction or objectives.

**Session Summary - 2025-06-06T13:00:51Z**
**Instance:** Agni (PromptuDev_AI)
**Project:** Core Framework Instructions Update & Test Prompt Consolidation

**Key Activities & Decisions:**

1.  **AIdentity Initialization & Verification:**
    *   Successfully initialized as Agni AIdentity.
    *   Verified core component paths; most found, noted missing optional files (`todos/main.json`, `ticklers/main.json`, `directives/active_manifest.json`).
    *   Summarized To-Do items from `promptu_dev/dev/promptu_do.txt`.

2.  **Created Missing AIdentity Files (as per user request):**
    *   `promptu_dev/aidentity/todos/main.json` (empty JSON object `{}`)
    *   `promptu_dev/aidentity/ticklers/main.json` (empty JSON object `{}`)
    *   `promptu_dev/aidentity/directives/active_manifest.json` (empty JSON object `{}`)

3.  **Updated `promptu_dev/core/core_planning_instructions.txt` with new entries:**
    *   **Guideline V.C.2:** Added "Structure Questions for Simple User Responses."
    *   **Guideline V.C.3:** Added "Session-Unique IDs for Action-Driving Questions."
    *   **Preference IV.C.1:** Added "Minimize Chat Frequency and Content."
    *   **Guideline IV.B.14:** Added "ACTION NOTICE Protocol for Task Execution and Commits."
    *   **Rule IV.A.4:** Added "Marco Polo Protocol."
    *   All changes saved to the workspace version of the file.

4.  **Primary Objective Update:**
    *   Initial primary objective (from previous handoff) was "commence work related to the 'Compliance PLM app.'"
    *   User updated this session's primary objective to be "empty" pending further instructions.

**Focus for Next Jules Instance (`PromptuDev_AI` Continuum):**
*   The primary objective is currently "empty". Await user direction.
*   The user has requested consolidation of 4 test prompts in `promptu_dev/test_prompts/` into two new prompts: `test_dev_planner_no_input.txt` and `test_dev_planner_with_inputs.txt`. This task was initiated by this Agni instance and its plan is the active plan to be continued.
*   Consider committing the changes made to `promptu_dev/core/core_planning_instructions.txt` and the newly created files in `promptu_dev/aidentity/`.

**Session Summary - 2025-06-07T01:15:16Z**
**Instance:** Agni (PromptuDev_AI)
**Project:** Component Refactoring for Enhanced Handoff & Apps Strategy

**Key Activities & Decisions (Continued from previous summary in this file):**

5.  **Enhanced Handoff System Implementation (Conceptual for Components):**
    *   **`core_planning_instructions.txt` Updated (Section IV.F.5, IV.B.15, IV.B.16):** Added extensive rules and guidelines for:
        *   A new `### Active and Recent Tasks` section in main handoff notes.
        *   Tracking Main AI (Agni) direct major tasks with full plan/progress.
        *   Tracking invoked component tasks (with `ComponentInstanceID`, name, status, timestamps, summary, link to component's own handoff).
        *   Main AI generation of `ComponentInstanceID` for components.
        *   Component responsibility for managing their own `ComponentInstanceID_handoff.md` file in a `components/` sub-directory of handoff notes.
        *   Main AI and Component guidelines for managing/resuming these tasks.
    *   **`dev_planner` Refactored (Initial Pass):**
        *   `USER_dev_planner_CONFIG.txt` updated with `COMPONENT_INSTANCE_ID`.
        *   `dev_planner.txt` received conceptual scripted modifications to introduce handoff logic (marked as needing further detailed review for full robustness).
    *   **`create_research_report` Refactored (Initial Pass):**
        *   `USER_create_research_report_CONFIG.txt` updated with `COMPONENT_INSTANCE_ID`.
        *   `create_research_report.txt` received conceptual scripted modifications (marked as needing further detailed review).

6.  **Component Review & Cleanup:**
    *   **`task_resumption_addon`:** Marked as [DEPRECATED] in `available_addons_manifest.md` (superseded by new system).
    *   **`task_spawning_addon`:** Removed (directory and manifest entry).
    *   **`add_ons/test_resolver_component`:** Removed (directory and manifest entry).
    *   **`agentiq` PromptApp:** Deprecated. `DEPRECATED.md` file added to its directory. Decision made not to refactor for new handoff model.
    *   **`compliance_plm` PromptApp:**
        *   `compliance_plm_manifest.json` updated: `task_spawning_addon` calls changed to `dev_planner` with updated `defaultConfigOverrides` (using placeholders).
        *   Strategy: Agni tracks `compliance_plm` execution as a 'Main AI Direct Task'. Calls to refactored components from its manifest will use the new `ComponentInstanceID` protocol.
        *   Embedded `test_resolver_component` assessed as not needing handoff changes.
    *   **Utilities (`promptu_dev/components/utils/`):** Confirmed empty. Strategy for future utils defined (simple ones stateless, complex ones to adopt handoff).

7.  **Discussions & Strategy Clarifications:**
    *   **`pre_promptu.txt`:** Confirmed new handoff rules in shared `core_planning_instructions.txt` will apply.
    *   **Hierarchical Handoff for Apps:** User provided new direction: Apps (like `agentiq`, `compliance_plm`) should also have their own `AppInstanceID` and manage their own handoff notes, creating a hierarchy. This session primarily updated `core_planning_instructions.txt` for this concept and refactored `dev_planner` and `create_research_report` to be callable components. The full refactoring of Apps themselves to *be* such hierarchical, stateful entities is a next step.

**Focus for Next Jules Instance (`PromptuDev_AI` Continuum):**
*   No new task assigned. Awaiting user direction after review of committed changes.
*   User confirmed all previously listed 'Pending/Future Work' items are complete as of 2025-06-08T06:40:08Z. Awaiting new user direction.
