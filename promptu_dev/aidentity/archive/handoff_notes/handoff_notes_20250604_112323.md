**Session Summary - 2025-06-04**
**Instance:** Jules

**Key Activities & Decisions:**
-   **`.ppa` System Design:** Discussed and designed a "Promptu Package Archive" (`.ppa`) system for component transfer. A detailed implementation prompt for this system (`prompt_for_implementing_ppa_system.txt`) was generated (though not committed in this session's final actions).
-   **File Storage & Directive Proposal Management:** Extensive discussion on standardizing file storage preferences and managing proposals for new operational directives. This culminated in the creation of `/promptu_dev/meta/operating_rules_management_proposal.txt` (committed) which outlines various approaches, favoring a "Dynamic Activation of Selected Directives via a Manifest" (Proposal C).
-   **New Core Guidelines Added:**
    -   Added B.6 ("Ensuring User Visibility of AI-Generated Files for Review") to `core_planning_instructions.txt`.
    -   Added B.7 ("Document Formatting and Naming Conventions") to `core_planning_instructions.txt`.
    -   These changes were committed.
-   **Core Instructions Reorganization Analysis:** Analyzed `core_planning_instructions.txt` and produced a report (`/promptu_dev/meta/ai_context_categories.md` - committed) detailing three potential reorganization options for future consideration.

**State of Deliverables:**
-   `/promptu_dev/meta/operating_rules_management_proposal.txt` created and committed.
-   `/promptu_dev/meta/ai_context_categories.md` created and committed.
-   `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt` updated with new guidelines B.6 and B.7 and committed.

**Next Steps (User):**
-   Review `operating_rules_management_proposal.txt` for decisions on directive management.
-   Review `ai_context_categories.md` for decisions on reorganizing core instructions.
-   Consider initiating implementation of the `.ppa` system using the generated prompt.
