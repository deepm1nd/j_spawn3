**Session Summary - 2025-06-05**
**Instance:** Jules
**Project:** Promptu Framework Core Enhancements

**Key Activities & Decisions:**

1.  **Documented AI Communication Style Guideline:**
    *   Added a new guideline to `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt` (Section V.C) instructing AI agents to present chat options with clear, copy-pasteable labels to improve user interaction efficiency.

2.  **Refactored `task_spawning_addon` into `dev_planner` Add-on:**
    *   **Renaming & File Creation:**
        *   New directory: `promptu/add_ons/dev_planner/`.
        *   New instruction file: `promptu/add_ons/dev_planner/dev_planner.txt`.
        *   New config file: `promptu/add_ons/dev_planner/USER_dev_planner_CONFIG.txt`.
        *   (Original `task_spawning_addon` directory and files remain for testing, per user request).
    *   **Configuration Standardization (`USER_dev_planner_CONFIG.txt`):**
        *   Updated to standard parameter format.
        *   Added `WORKFLOW_TYPE` parameter ("Monolithic", "DelegatedPlanning", "HybridIterative"; Default: "Monolithic").
        *   Revised `MAIN_DEV_PLAN_FILENAME` description: now an overview/manifest for modular submodule plans.
        *   Updated `BASE_OUTPUT_PATH` description: guidance for relative KB pathing.
    *   **Core Logic Enhancements (`dev_planner.txt`):**
        *   **Parameter Handling (Section I):** Updated for new name, config file, `Resolved_DP_` variables.
        *   **Initial Research Phase (Section II.0):** `dev_planner` initiates D2-level research (default `ITERATIVE_OUTPUT_DEPTH: 2`) via `create_research_report`. KB outputs go to shared, mode-appropriate, project-specific, and task-determined domain name locations (e.g., `[mode_root]/kb/[ProjectName]/[DomainName]/`), updating `master_domain_log.md`.
        *   **Modular Main Plan Output:** `MAIN_DEV_PLAN_FILENAME` is an overview; detailed plans are multiple `[ModuleName]_submodule_dev_plan.md` files.
        *   **Workflow Implementation (Section II.0.f & II.1):**
            *   **Monolithic:** Refactored for modular sub-planning by "Sub-Planning Task AIs", followed by user review handoffs, then developer task generation from approved submodule plans.
            *   **DelegatedPlanning:** Detailed logic for `dev_planner` to define planning sub-tasks, spawn Planning Task AIs, then HALT for user merging of sub-plans before developer task spawning (on re-invocation).
            *   **HybridIterative:** Detailed logic for iterative, phase-by-phase planning and development cycles, with user review points.
            *   All workflows use main session `handoff_notes.md` for state management and resumption.
        *   **Worker Task Research Capabilities (Section III.B):** Worker tasks can use `dev_planner`'s central research or conduct their own focused research, with outputs contributing to the shared KB in an organized manner.
        *   **Merge Conflict Mitigation:** Logic requires `dev_planner` to design tasks to avoid concurrent creation of files targeting the same final path, by decomposing work into distinct files or serializing conflicting tasks.

3.  **Updated Framework References:**
    *   `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt`: `Known_Primary_Directive_Addon_Apps` updated to `dev_planner`.
    *   `promptu_dev/guides/p_gritos_dev_plan_spawn_example.md`: References updated to `dev_planner`.
    *   `promptu/add_ons/available_addons_manifest.md`: `dev_planner` entry updated (new capabilities, `WORKFLOW_TYPE` param). Legacy `task_spawning_addon` entry retained and marked for testing. Other addon descriptions updated to refer to `dev_planner`.

**Pending/In-Progress Tasks:**
None from this plan.

**Next Steps (User):**
*   Review all changes.
*   Consider testing the new `dev_planner` add-on with one of its workflows.
*   Eventually plan deletion of the legacy `task_spawning_addon` directory.

**Session Summary - 2025-06-06T02:27:15Z**
**Instance:** Jules (Current Instance)
**Project:** Promptu Framework Development & `dev_planner` Enhancement

**Summary of Recently Completed Work:**

1.  **`dev_planner` Add-on Major Enhancements:**
    *   Redesigned `dev_planner` to support a comprehensive "Iterative Phased Development Process."
    *   Updated `USER_dev_planner_CONFIG.txt` with new/modified parameters: `PROJECT_SPECIFICATIONS_REF` (now a list), `PLAN_EXEMPLAR_REFS` (new name, list of files), `PLAN_METHODOLOGY_GUIDES` (list, supports directory traversal), and `USER_PLAN_PROPOSAL_PATH`.
    *   Significantly updated `dev_planner.txt` with new logic for: mandatory user confirmation of inputs, advanced parameter handling, a conflict/ambiguity resolution protocol, new "Acceptance Analysis" and "Remediation Planning" modes, and a Monolithic workflow fallback mechanism.
    *   All changes related to these `dev_planner` enhancements have been committed.

2.  **Supporting Artifacts Created:**
    *   New user guide: `promptu/add_ons/dev_planner/dev_planner_user_guide.md`.
    *   Drafted generic prompt content for a `PromptuDev_AI` orchestrator instance.
    *   Created two specific test scenarios (post_promptu and handoff files) for `PromptuDev_AI` in `promptu_dev/test_prompts/` (one with a user plan proposal, one without). These test artifacts have also been committed.

**Focus for Next Jules Instance (`PromptuDev_AI` Continuum):**

*   **The primary objective for the next session is to commence work related to the "Compliance PLM app."**
*   The next instance should initialize by reading the core framework instructions (`promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt`) and these handoff notes.
*   It should then await specific tasks, requirements, or objectives from the user for the **design and development of the new Compliance PLM application.**
*   The preceding work on `dev_planner` and its test setup is considered complete for this current development cycle.

**Session Summary - 2025-06-06T05:56:58Z (Interim Note)**
**Instance:** Jules (Current Instance)
**Project:** Instance Identity Framework Documentation

**Key Activity:**
*   The new documentation file `promptu_dev/meta/framework_instance_identity.md`, detailing the V1 design for the Instance Identity Framework (including AIdentity Model, aidentity_context.json structure, Startup Workflow, Todo/Tickler systems, Communication Protocols, and Action Notice Protocol) has been successfully drafted and written to disk.

**Next Step:**
*   The immediate next step is to prepare and seek approval for a commit of the new `promptu_dev/meta/framework_instance_identity.md` file and this updated `handoff_notes.md`.

**Session Summary - 2025-06-06T10:01:44Z**
**Instance:** Jules (Current Instance)
**Project:** AIdentity Framework - Path Restructure Preparation

**Summary of File Content Changes Prepared in This Session:**

The following files have had their *content* updated to reflect the new target directory structure (with `/aidentity/`, `/components/`, etc.) and AIdentity conventions. They remain in their *current* locations pending user-led directory restructuring:
1.  **`promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt`**: Internal paths updated for component discovery, `aidentity/` handoff notes, `dev/` folder for developer meta files.
2.  **Content for `Agni`'s Master Prompt (`/promptu_dev/aidentity/promptu_qb.txt`)**: Drafted content (formerly "PromptuDev_AI_orchestrator_post_promptu.txt") updated with correct relative paths (e.g., `../core/`, `../components/`).
3.  **`promptu/add_ons/available_addons_manifest.md`**: Add-on instruction file paths updated to `components/add_ons/`.
4.  **`promptu/add_ons/dev_planner/dev_planner.txt`**: Internal KB paths updated to point to AIdentity-specific KBs (e.g., `../../aidentity/kb/`) and `MASTER_DOMAIN_LOG_PATH` updated similarly.
5.  **`promptu/add_ons/create_research_report/create_research_report.txt`**: Default `KbBaseDir` updated to point to AIdentity-specific KBs.
6.  **`promptu/add_ons/create_research_report/USER_create_research_report_CONFIG.txt`**: `REPORT_IDENTIFIER` parameter (or equivalent for report output base path) made 'Required' with no default.

**New DRAFT `aidentity_context.json` Files Created:**
*   `promptu_dev/agni_aidentity_context_DRAFT.json`
*   `promptu/kavia_aidentity_context_DRAFT.json`
These contain the V1 JSON structures for `Agni` and `Kavia` AIdentities with correct future-relative paths for their profile components.

**All above changes are ready to be committed.**

---
**Remaining Meta-Plan & Instructions for Next Steps:**

**Meta-Plan Step 4: Commit All Updated Files (Current Jules Instance - after this handoff note is written)**
*   This Jules instance will issue a `COMMIT ACTION NOTICE` for all files listed above.
*   **USER ACTION:** Approve the commit.
*   This Jules instance will then perform the commit. After the commit, this instance's work is complete for this session.

**Meta-Plan Step 5: Perform Directory Restructuring (USER ACTION - THIS IS YOU)**
*   **CRITICAL:** After the commit in Step 4 is successful, you will manually perform the major directory restructuring in your local repository.
*   **New Top-Level Structure (for both `/promptu/` and `/promptu_dev/`):**
    *   `aidentity/`
    *   `components/`
    *   `core/`
    *   `ipc/`
*   **Specific to `/promptu_dev/` (for `Agni` AIdentity):**
    *   An additional top-level special folder: `dev/`
    *   The `test_prompts/` folder also remains top-level in `/promptu_dev/`.
*   **Detailed Moves (Example for `/promptu_dev/` - apply similarly for `/promptu/`):**
    1.  **Create new top-level folders:**
        *   `/promptu_dev/aidentity/`
        *   `/promptu_dev/components/`
        *   `/promptu_dev/dev/`
        *   (Ensure `/promptu_dev/core/` and `/promptu_dev/ipc/` exist as top-level).
    2.  **Move `aidentity_context.json` drafts:**
        *   Move `promptu_dev/agni_aidentity_context_DRAFT.json` to `/promptu_dev/aidentity/aidentity_context.json`.
        *   Move `promptu/kavia_aidentity_context_DRAFT.json` to `/promptu/aidentity/aidentity_context.json`.
    3.  **Populate `/promptu_dev/aidentity/`:**
        *   Move `promptu_dev/meta/handoff_notes.md` (this file, after commit) to `/promptu_dev/aidentity/handoff_notes.md`.
        *   Move `promptu_dev/meta/archive/` to `/promptu_dev/aidentity/archive/`.
        *   Create `/promptu_dev/aidentity/kb/` and move relevant shared KBs (like `interface_based_design_best_practices`, `rust_software_partitioning`, etc., which were formerly in `/promptu_dev/kb/`) into it. Also create `Agni`'s `master_domain_log.md` here.
        *   Create subdirectories like `logs/`, `profiles/`, `state/`, `todos/`, `ticklers/`, `master_prompts/`, `directives/` within `/promptu_dev/aidentity/`.
        *   Create `Agni`'s Master Prompt: Place the (conceptually updated) content for `Agni`'s `promptu_qb.txt` into `/promptu_dev/aidentity/promptu_qb.txt`.
    4.  **Populate `/promptu_dev/components/`:**
        *   Move existing `/promptu_dev/add_ons/` into `/promptu_dev/components/add_ons/`.
        *   Move existing `/promptu_dev/apps/` into `/promptu_dev/components/apps/`.
        *   Move existing `/promptu_dev/tasks/` into `/promptu_dev/components/tasks/`.
        *   Move existing `/promptu_dev/utils/` into `/promptu_dev/components/utils/`.
    5.  **Populate `/promptu_dev/core/`:**
        *   Ensure `core_planning_instructions.txt`, `base_iep.txt` are here.
        *   Move existing general `/promptu_dev/guides/` into `/promptu_dev/core/guides/`.
        *   Move existing `/promptu_dev/examples/` into `/promptu_dev/core/examples/`.
        *   Ensure `ops/` (for guidelines/rules) is under `core/`.
    6.  **Populate `/promptu_dev/dev/`:**
        *   Move all *other* content from the current `/promptu_dev/meta/` (e.g., `promptu_do.txt`, `framework_instance_identity.md` [once created], `frame_of_reference_concept.md`) into `/promptu_dev/dev/`.
*   **Commit your structural changes to your local repository.**

**Meta-Plan Step 6: Initiate New Jules Instance (USER ACTION - THIS IS YOU)**
*   Use a continuation prompt that correctly points to the *new location* of `core_planning_instructions.txt` and the relevant `aidentity/handoff_notes.md` for the `Agni` AIdentity.
*   The invocation `post_promptu.txt` for this new instance should be one of the test prompts we created (e.g., `/promptu_dev/test_prompts/PromptuDev_AI_Test1_NoProposal_post_promptu.txt`), ensuring its internal `[[PROCESS_FRAMEWORK_INSTRUCTIONS FROM ...]]` directive uses the new correct path to `core_planning_instructions.txt`.

**Meta-Plan Step 7: Verify New Structure & Path Integrity (New Jules Instance Action)**
*   The new Jules instance (as `Agni`, using its `/promptu_dev/aidentity/promptu_qb.txt` master prompt) will:
    *   Verify its context loading.
    *   Attempt to check key component paths and report any broken references.
    *   Await your instructions for further tasks (like proceeding to document the framework).

**Recovery/Debugging Advice for User Restructuring (Step 5):**
*   **Reference Commit:** The commit made in Meta-Plan Step 4 (the one this Jules instance is about to propose) will contain all files with *correct content* but in their *old locations*. This commit is your primary reference if you need to check original content or if a file is misplaced.
*   **Key Files to Verify After Your Move:**
    *   `/promptu_dev/aidentity/aidentity_context.json` (and Kavia's equivalent).
    *   `/promptu_dev/aidentity/promptu_qb.txt` (and Kavia's).
    *   `/promptu_dev/core/core_planning_instructions.txt`.
*   **Path Issues:** If the next Jules instance fails, it's likely due to:
    *   `core_planning_instructions.txt` not found by the `[[PROCESS...]]` directive in the *invocation `post_promptu.txt`* or in the AIdentity's `promptu_qb.txt`.
    *   The AIdentity not finding its `aidentity/aidentity_context.json`.
    *   Paths *inside* `aidentity_context.json` or `promptu_qb.txt` being incorrect for the new structure.
    *   Relative paths from moved add_ons/apps (like `dev_planner.txt`) to KBs or core files being miscalculated. The commit from Step 4 should have the correct *internal* relative paths for these files based on their *new* intended locations.
