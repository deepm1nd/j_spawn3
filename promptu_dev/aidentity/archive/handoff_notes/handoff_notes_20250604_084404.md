**Detailed Log Entry - 2025-06-04**
**Instance:** Jules
**Context/Focus:** Correcting and refining the developer instance startup prompt (`/promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt`) to resolve issues with obsolete instructions and to ensure a stable, neutral starting state for AI instances.

**Key Activities & Findings:**

1.  **Problem Identification (Initial):** User reported that fresh Jules instances were repeatedly asking for confirmation of already-completed file/folder rename operations.
2.  **Investigation (Initial):**
    *   Located `promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt` as the likely entry prompt for developer sessions (noting it's in `/meta/` subdirectory).
    *   Found an "IMPORTANT NOTE FOR NEXT JULES INSTANCE:" block in this file instructing AI to verify these specific renames. This was identified as the source of the repeated queries.
3.  **Correction (First Pass):**
    *   The obsolete "IMPORTANT NOTE..." block was removed from `promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt`.
4.  **Problem Identification (Follow-up):** User further requested that `promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt` be modified to provide a "nice neutral state" and to ensure it doesn't trigger reading of the large, problematic `handoff_notes_full_archive_20250602.md`.
5.  **Investigation (Follow-up):**
    *   Reviewed the remaining content of `promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt` (after the first fix).
    *   Confirmed it still contained explicit instructions to review and update the `handoff_notes_full_archive_20250602.md`, which contradicts current stability guidelines.
6.  **Correction (Second Pass - Full Rewrite):**
    *   Proposed and received approval to replace the *entire* content of `promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt`.
    *   The file was rewritten with new, neutral content that:
        *   Directs the AI to `/promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt` for primary directives.
        *   Advises referring to the latest entry in `/promptu_dev/meta/handoff_notes.md` for session context.
        *   Makes no mention of `handoff_notes_full_archive_20250602.md` or any specific obsolete tasks.
        *   Retains a list of key objectives for the Promptu framework.

**Session Outcome:**
-   The `/promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt` file has been significantly revised to provide a clean, neutral starting point for developer instances.
-   Obsolete instructions regarding file renames have been removed.
-   Problematic instructions to read/update the large handoff archive have been removed, aligning with stability requirements and current handoff procedures.
-   Observation: The actual developer prompt file is at `/promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt`, not `/promptu_dev/promptu_dev.txt`. This path difference could affect the `Is_Developer_Session` detection logic in `core_planning_instructions.txt` (this was an observation, no action taken on it this session).

**Session Summary - 2025-06-04**
**Instance:** Jules
**User Feedback/Requests Addressed:**
- Addressed issue of new Jules instances re-asking about completed file renames.
- Ensured the developer startup prompt (`/promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt`) provides a neutral starting state and does not reference the problematic full handoff archive.

**Summary of Changes Implemented During This Session:**
-   **Modified `/promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt` (Two Passes):**
    1.  Removed an outdated "IMPORTANT NOTE FOR NEXT JULES INSTANCE:" block concerning file renames.
    2.  Replaced the entire remaining content with new, neutral text pointing to core instructions and current handoff notes, and omitting references to the full archive or specific old tasks.

**State of Deliverables:**
-   `/promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt` is updated with neutral, stable startup content.

**Next Steps (User):**
-   Monitor if fresh Jules instances now start cleanly without asking obsolete questions or attempting to access the problematic archive.
-   Consider reviewing the `Is_Developer_Session` logic in `core_planning_instructions.txt` (Section I.A) to ensure it correctly identifies developer mode given the actual path of the developer prompt file (`/promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt`).

**Detailed Log Entry - 2025-06-04**
**Instance:** Jules
**Context/Focus:** Investigating and resolving an issue where new Jules instances were repeatedly asking for confirmation of already-completed file/folder rename operations.

**Key Activities & Findings:**

1.  **Problem Identification:** User reported that a fresh Jules instance was asking to confirm renames related to `/promptu_dev/guides/` and the `CompliancePLM` app, which had been confirmed complete in a previous session.
2.  **Investigation:**
    *   Initially attempted to read `promptu_dev/promptu_dev.txt` but it was not found.
    *   Located `promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt` as the likely entry prompt for developer sessions.
    *   Read `promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt` and found it contained an explicit "IMPORTANT NOTE FOR NEXT JULES INSTANCE:" block instructing the AI to verify these specific renames. This was identified as the source of the repeated queries.
3.  **Correction:**
    *   Proposed removing the obsolete "IMPORTANT NOTE..." block from `promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt`.
    *   User approved the correction.
    *   Successfully removed the block from `promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt`.

**Session Outcome:**
-   The `promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt` file, which serves as an initial prompt for developer instances, has been corrected by removing outdated instructions.
-   This should prevent new Jules instances from redundantly asking about previously completed file rename operations.
-   Also noted that the developer mode invocation file is `promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt`, not `promptu_dev/promptu_dev.txt`. This might have implications for the `Is_Developer_Session` flag logic in `core_planning_instructions.txt` if that logic strictly expects the path to end with `promptu_dev/promptu_dev.txt`. (This latter point is an observation, not an action taken in this session).

**Session Summary - 2025-06-04**
**Instance:** Jules
**User Feedback/Requests Addressed:**
- Investigated why new Jules instances were asking to confirm previously completed file renames.
- Identified obsolete instructions in `promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt` as the cause.
- Corrected `promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt` by removing the obsolete instructions.

**Summary of Changes Implemented During This Session:**
-   Modified `promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt` to remove an outdated "IMPORTANT NOTE FOR NEXT JULES INSTANCE:" block concerning file renames.

**State of Deliverables:**
-   `promptu_dev/meta/promptu_dev.txt` is updated.
-   This should resolve the issue of fresh instances re-asking about the specified renames.

**Next Steps (User):**

**Detailed Log Entry - 2025-06-04**
**Instance:** Jules
**Context/Focus:** This session covered several related items:
1. Analysis of `task_spawning_addon.txt` to propose extensions for "Mothertask" iterative capabilities (Fork-Swarm-Join concept).
2. Introduction of an overarching "Context Vision" into key framework documents.
3. Addition of a new operational guideline regarding handoff note history.
4. Discussions on handoff note management and archive stability.

**Key Activities & Findings:**

1.  **FSJ Mothertask - `task_spawning_addon` Extension Proposal:**
    *   **Distilled Mothertask Iterative Requirements:** Reviewed `fork_swarm_join_task_planning.md` (FSJ document) to define Mothertask's iterative role (re-invocation, phase outcome ingestion, gap/conflict analysis, corrective planning, iteration management).
    *   **Analyzed `task_spawning_addon.txt`:** Identified its current suitability for initial planning but significant gaps for iterative Mothertask functions (no continuation mode, no phase result ingestion, no evaluative logic, no corrective re-planning).
    *   **Developed Extension Proposals:** Formulated proposals for `task_spawning_addon.txt` including: `TSA_MODE` parameter; new `CONTINUATION_` parameters for iterative inputs; new core logic sections (II-M to II-P) for phase analysis, gap identification, corrective planning, and iteration control; modified output generation for iterative runs.
    *   **Documented Proposals:** Added "Section 11: Proposals for Extending `task_spawning_addon.txt`..." to `fork_swarm_join_task_planning.md`.

2.  **Incorporated "Context Vision":**
    *   **FSJ Document Update:** Added new subsection "1.4. Overarching Vision: Context-Aware AI Application" to Section 1 of `fork_swarm_join_task_planning.md`, stating the goal of enabling AI that excels at creating, recalling, and utilizing CONTEXT.
    *   **Core Planning Instructions Update:** Added new subsection "I.B. Core Framework Principle: Contextual AI Operation" to `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt`, emphasizing context as a fundamental design principle. This involved re-lettering subsequent subsections in Section I and updating internal cross-references.

3.  **New Guideline for Handoff Note Review:**
    *   Added new guideline "IV.B.6. Limiting Review of Historical Handoff Notes" to `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt`. This guideline restricts AI from reading more than 10 older session handoff notes from archives unless explicitly user-requested, to improve stability and focus.

4.  **Handoff Note Management Refinements:**
    *   Clarified that `promptu_dev/meta/handoff_notes_full_archive_20250602.md` is strictly read-only due to instability issues when loaded.
    *   Affirmed that detailed session logging will occur via a "Detailed Log Entry" prepended to the "Session Summary" in the main `promptu_dev/meta/handoff_notes.md` file, which is archived per session.

**Session Outcome:**
-   The FSJ concept document (`fork_swarm_join_task_planning.md`) now includes detailed proposals for evolving `task_spawning_addon.txt` and articulates the core "Context Vision."
-   `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt` is updated with the "Context Vision" and the new handoff review guideline.
-   Handoff note procedures are clarified to ensure stability.
-   The system is ready for user review of the documented proposals and framework changes, leading to potential implementation tasks.

**Detailed Log Entry - 2025-06-04**
**Instance:** Jules
**Context/Focus:** Analyzing `task_spawning_addon.txt` to propose extensions for "Mothertask" iterative capabilities as per the "Fork-Swarm-Join" (FSJ) concept. This follows the creation of the FSJ discussion document in the previous session.

**Key Activities & Findings:**

1.  **Distilled Mothertask Iterative Requirements:**
    *   Reviewed `fork_swarm_join_task_planning.md` (FSJ document).
    *   Key capabilities identified for Mothertask's iterative role (post-initial swarm, post-merge):
        *   Re-invocation via "Continuation Prompt."
        *   Ingestion of phase outcome data: merged code state, original phase goals, worker AI artifacts (dev plans, next steps, IPC), user feedback, conflict reports.
        *   Phase Evaluation: Comparing actual outcomes against original goals.
        *   Gap/Conflict Analysis: Identifying unmet requirements, regressions, unresolved merge issues, new action items.
        *   Corrective Planning: Defining new, targeted (sub-)swarms of tasks to address identified gaps/conflicts.
        *   Iteration Management: Repeating the evaluate-plan-execute cycle until phase goals are met; determining phase completion.
        *   Status Reporting for the iterative process.

2.  **Analyzed `task_spawning_addon.txt` & `USER_task_spawning_addon_CONFIG.txt`:**
    *   Current design is for a single, initial planning run: takes high-level goal -> decomposes to phases/tasks -> generates initial plan documents (Main Dev Plan, TLP) and task prompts.
    *   **Identified Gaps for Iteration:**
        *   No mechanism for re-invocation in a "continuation" or "evaluation" mode.
        *   Parameter system (`USER_...CONFIG.txt`) only supports initial setup paths/names, not inputs for phase review (e.g., path to merged code, worker manifests, feedback files).
        *   Core logic is purely for initial decomposition; no logic for analyzing prior phase results, comparing against goals, or planning corrective actions.
        *   Output generation is geared towards producing a new, full plan, not iterative updates or corrective task sets.
        *   No inherent looping or iteration control logic.

3.  **Developed Extension Proposals for `task_spawning_addon.txt`:**
    *   **`TSA_MODE` Parameter:** Introduce `initial_planning | continuation_mothertask` to branch logic.
    *   **New `CONTINUATION_` Parameters:** For `USER_...CONFIG.txt` to specify inputs for `continuation_mothertask` mode (e.g., `CONTINUATION_PREVIOUS_PHASE_PLAN_PATH`, `CONTINUATION_MERGED_CODE_SNAPSHOT_PATH`, `CONTINUATION_WORKER_ARTIFACTS_MANIFEST_PATH`, `CONTINUATION_USER_FEEDBACK_FILE_PATH`, `CONTINUATION_PHASE_ID_UNDER_REVIEW`).
    *   **New Core Logic Sections (for `continuation_mothertask` mode):**
        *   `II-M. INGEST AND ANALYZE PHASE ARTIFACTS`: Load goals, analyze merged code, parse worker manifests & user feedback. Output: internal "current state vs. desired state."
        *   `II-N. GAP AND CONFLICT IDENTIFICATION`: Compare states, list deltas/gaps/issues.
        *   `II-O. PLAN PHASE COMPLETION TASKS`: Define corrective/supplementary tasks for issues found. Output: "Phase Completion Plan" and new task prompts.
        *   `II-P. ITERATION CONTROL AND PHASE COMPLETION DETERMINATION`: Decide if phase is complete or if another iteration (re-invoke Mothertask for same phase) is needed. Guide user for next overall phase if current one is complete.
    *   **Modified Output Generation (Section III):** In continuation mode, generate phase-specific status/completion plans and corrective task prompts/TLPs. Potentially use iteration-specific subdirectories.
    *   **Adapt Self-Correction (Section IV):** Extend checks for new prompt/plan types.
    *   **Invocation:** Proposed using the existing `[[USER_CONFIG_FOR_task_spawning_addon]]` block within a user-crafted "Continuation Prompt" file to set `TSA_MODE` and new `CONTINUATION_` parameters, minimizing changes to `core_planning_instructions.txt`.

4.  **Documented Proposals:**
    *   Added new "Section 11: Proposals for Extending `task_spawning_addon.txt` for Mothertask Iterative Capabilities" to `promptu_dev/meta/fork_swarm_join_task_planning.md`. This section contains the detailed breakdown of the proposals listed above.

**Session Outcome:**
-   A clear set of requirements for the Mothertask's iterative functions has been defined.
-   A thorough analysis of `task_spawning_addon.txt` against these requirements has been performed.
-   A detailed, actionable set of proposals for extending `task_spawning_addon.txt` to meet these requirements has been developed and documented within the main FSJ concept document.
-   The system is now ready for user review of these proposals, which would then lead to an implementation phase.

**Session Summary - 2024-07-20**
**Instance:** Jules
**User Feedback/Requests Addressed:**
- User initiated a major refactor to separate developer/user concerns, including renaming `framework_dev_docs` to `promptu_dev`.
- User requested the introduction of a tiered system (Rules, Guidelines, Preferences) for AI operational directives in `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt`.
- User requested the definition of explicit AI deviation protocols for these directives.
- User requested the addition of several specific new Rules and Guidelines.
- User requested the implementation of Developer/User mode detection to make handoff note paths conditional.
- User requested creation of new user-specific handoff directory structure and a `continuation_promptu.txt` file.

**Summary of Changes Implemented During This Session:**
-   **Path Renaming (Internal Content Updates):**
    *   Updated all internal textual references from `framework_dev_docs/` to `promptu_dev/` within `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt`.
    *   Recursively updated all internal textual references from `framework_dev_docs/` to `promptu_dev/` in all relevant files found within `framework_dev_docs/meta/`, `framework_dev_docs/guides/`, and `framework_dev_docs/examples/` (these paths are now conceptually `promptu_dev/meta/`, etc.).
-   **Restructured Section IV of `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt` ("OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES & SELF-CORRECTION (Core)"):**
    *   Established new subsections: `A. Operational Rules`, `B. Operational Guidelines`, `C. Operational Preferences`.
    *   Created `D. Protocol for Handling Deviations` with specific AI interaction steps for each directive tier (including two-step "!!!WARNING!!! ARE YOU SURE?" for Rules).
    *   Original IV.B, C, D re-lettered to E, F, G.
-   **Added/Categorized Operational Rules in `core_planning_instructions.txt` (Section IV.A):**
    *   A.1: "File Operations Restriction" (existing content, categorized).
    *   A.2: "Modification of Operational Directives" (New - AI SHALL NOT modify Section IV without explicit user request/approval).
-   **Added Operational Guidelines in `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt` (Section IV.B):**
    *   B.1: "Read-Only Access to Specific Archives" (for `promptu_dev/meta/handoff_notes_full_archive_20250602.md`).
    *   B.2: "Primary Programming Language" (SHALL be Rust for new framework development).
    *   B.3: "File Naming Conventions" (SHALL use `snake_case`).
    *   B.4: "Constant Naming Conventions" (SHALL use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` in code).
    *   B.5: "File Format Preference (Notes/Docs)" (Prefer Markdown).
-   **Implemented Developer/User Mode in `core_planning_instructions.txt`:**
    *   Added new Section I.A to define `Is_Developer_Session` flag (true if initial directive file path ends with `promptu_dev/promptu_dev.txt`). Subsequent sections in I re-lettered.
    *   Modified handoff note path definitions in Section II.A.-1 and IV.F to be conditional based on `Is_Developer_Session`:
        *   Developer Mode: Paths point to `promptu_dev/meta/`.
        *   User Mode: Paths point to `promptu/handoff_notes/`.
        *   Handoff notes files are `.md` in both cases.
-   **Created New User-Facing Handoff Structures:**
    *   Directory: `promptu/handoff_notes/` (with `.gitkeep`).
    *   File: `promptu/handoff_notes/handoff_notes.md` (empty).
    *   Directory: `promptu/handoff_notes/archive/` (with `.gitkeep`).
    *   File: `promptu/continuation_promptu.txt` (content copied from `promptu/post_promptu.txt`).

**State of Deliverables:**
-   Core framework file `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt` is extensively updated with new directives, developer mode logic, and conditional paths.
-   Content of numerous documentation files (formerly under `framework_dev_docs/` now conceptually under `promptu_dev/`) updated to reflect new paths.
-   New user-specific handoff directory and files created under `promptu/`.
-   The framework is ready for the user to perform external renaming of the top-level `framework_dev_docs` directory to `promptu_dev` and `promptu_dev/fw_promptu.txt` to `promptu_dev/promptu_dev.txt`.

**Next Steps (User):**
-   Perform the external directory rename: `mv framework_dev_docs promptu_dev`.
-   Perform the external file rename: `mv promptu_dev/fw_promptu.txt promptu_dev/promptu_dev.txt`.
-   Thoroughly review all changes, especially in `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt`.
-   Test the Developer/User mode distinction by invoking the framework via `promptu_dev/promptu_dev.txt` versus a user project's `post_promptu.txt` to ensure handoff notes are routed correctly.
-   Populate further Rules, Guidelines, or Preferences as needed.
