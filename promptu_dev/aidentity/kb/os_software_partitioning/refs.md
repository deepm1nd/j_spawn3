    *   Key Takeaways: Defines user space and kernel space, the purpose of separation (memory/hardware protection, stability, security), implementation via CPU modes, and the role of system calls as the interface.

    *   Key Takeaways: Defines IPC, lists various approaches (files, signals, sockets, message queues, pipes, shared memory, message passing, memory-mapped files), and their importance for communication between isolated processes, especially in microkernel architectures.

    *   Key Takeaways (relevance to OS): General principles of breaking software into independent modules with well-defined interfaces, applicable to OS component design (e.g., subsystems like memory management, file systems as modules).

    *   Key Takeaways (relevance to OS): Details an OS architecture that heavily emphasizes partitioning by moving traditional kernel services into user-space server processes, relying on IPC as the core interface. Discusses process isolation, device drivers in user space, and the minimality principle.

## Related Concepts (Covered in Broader Interface Design Research)

*   **System Call:** While not a standalone document in this specific research, the concept of system calls as the interface between user space and kernel space is a recurring theme in the "User space and kernel space" and "Microkernel" articles.
*   **Process Isolation:** This is a direct consequence of user space/kernel space separation and virtual memory management, discussed in the "User space and kernel space" article.
*   **Monolithic Kernel & Hybrid Kernel:** These architectures are discussed and contrasted in the "Microkernel" article, providing context on different OS partitioning strategies.
*   **Loadable Kernel Modules:** Mentioned in the "Microkernel" article (often in comparison) and is a common feature of monolithic kernels like Linux for providing modularity.
