## Content for: The `with` Statement: Syntax and Basic Usage

The `with` statement in Python is a control flow structure used to simplify resource management and exception handling. It provides a way to ensure that resources are properly acquired (set up) before a block of code is executed and reliably released (torn down) afterward, even if errors occur within the block.

**Core Syntax:**
```python
with expression [as variable]:
    # block_of_code
    # ... variable (if provided) is available here ...
# Resource cleanup happens here
```

-   **`expression`**: This must evaluate to an object that supports the context management protocol (i.e., a context manager).
-   **`as variable` (optional)**: If present, the value returned by the context manager's `__enter__()` method is bound to `variable`. This variable is then available within `block_of_code`. Some context managers return `self` (the context manager instance itself), while others might return a different object (e.g., a file object when `open()` is used). If `__enter__()` returns `None` or no useful object, the `as variable` clause can be omitted.

**Execution Flow:**
1.  The `expression` is evaluated to obtain a context manager object.
2.  The context manager's `__enter__()` method is called. If an `as variable` clause is present, the return value of `__enter__()` is assigned to `variable`.
3.  The `block_of_code` inside the `with` statement is executed.
4.  If an exception occurs during the execution of `block_of_code`, the context manager's `__exit__()` method is called with the exception details. The `__exit__()` method can then handle the exception. If it returns `True`, the exception is suppressed. If it returns `False` (or `None` implicitly), the exception is re-raised after `__exit__()` completes.
5.  If no exception occurs in `block_of_code`, the `__exit__()` method is still called, but its `exc_type`, `exc_value`, and `exc_tb` arguments will be `None`.

**Advantages:**
-   **Readability:** Makes the code cleaner and more expressive by abstracting the setup and teardown logic.
-   **Safety:** Guarantees that cleanup logic (in `__exit__`) is executed, reducing the risk of resource leaks (e.g., unclosed files, unreleased locks).
-   **Reusability:** Well-defined context managers can be reused across different parts of an application or in different projects.

**Example (File Handling):**
```python
# Traditional try...finally
try:
    f = open("my_file.txt", "w")
    f.write("Hello, world!")
finally:
    if f:
        f.close()

# Using 'with' statement
with open("my_file.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, world!")
# f is automatically closed here
```
The `with` statement version is more concise and guarantees closure.

## Content for: The Context Management Protocol: `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` Methods

The context management protocol in Python is defined by two special methods that a class must implement to function as a context manager and support the `with` statement:

1.  **`__enter__(self)`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Called when the `with` statement is entered, immediately after the context manager object is obtained. It is responsible for setting up the necessary state or acquiring the resource(s) that the context manager is managing.
    *   **Return Value:** The value returned by `__enter__()` is bound to the target variable specified in the `as` clause of the `with` statement. If no `as` clause is used, or if the context manager doesn't need to provide an object to the `with` block, `__enter__()` can return `None`. A common pattern is for `__enter__()` to return `self` if the context manager instance itself is what will be used within the `with` block.
    *   **Example:**
        ```python
        class MyContextManager:
            def __init__(self, resource_name):
                self.resource_name = resource_name
                self.resource = None # Placeholder for acquired resource

            def __enter__(self):
                print(f"Entering context: Acquiring {self.resource_name}")
                self.resource = f"Acquired:{self.resource_name}" # Simulate acquisition
                return self.resource # This value goes to the 'as' variable

            def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
                print(f"Exiting context: Releasing {self.resource_name}")
                if self.resource:
                    print(f"Resource {self.resource} released.")
                # Exception handling logic would go here
                return False # Do not suppress exceptions by default
        ```

2.  **`__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, exc_tb)`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Called when the flow of execution leaves the `with` statement's block, regardless of whether the block completed normally or an exception occurred. It is responsible for performing any cleanup actions, such as releasing acquired resources.
    *   **Arguments:**
        *   `exc_type`: The type of the exception that occurred within the `with` block. If no exception occurred, this will be `None`.
        *   `exc_value`: The instance of the exception. If no exception, this will be `None`.
        *   `exc_tb` (traceback): A traceback object providing details about where the exception occurred. If no exception, this will be `None`.
    *   **Return Value (Exception Handling):**
        *   If `__exit__()` returns `True`, any exception that occurred in the `with` block is "swallowed" (suppressed), and execution continues normally after the `with` statement.
        *   If `__exit__()` returns `False` (or `None` implicitly), any exception that occurred is re-raised after `__exit__()` completes. This is the default behavior.
    *   **Guaranteed Execution:** The `__exit__()` method is guaranteed to be called if the `__enter__()` method completes successfully. This makes it the ideal place for cleanup logic.

Understanding these two methods is fundamental to both using and creating custom context managers.

## Content for: Creating Class-Based Context Managers

Creating a context manager using a class involves defining a class that implements the context management protocol, specifically the `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods.

**Structure:**
```python
class CustomContextManager:
    def __init__(self, params): # Optional: to initialize the context manager
        print(f"Initializing with: {params}")
        self.params = params
        # Initialize any state needed by the context manager

    def __enter__(self):
        print(f"Setting up resources for: {self.params}")
        # Acquire resources, perform setup actions
        # For example, open a file, acquire a lock, connect to a database
        # Return the object to be used in the 'with' block (bound to 'as' variable)
        # Often, 'return self' is used if the context manager instance itself is the managed resource
        managed_resource = f"Managed resource for {self.params}"
        return managed_resource

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, exc_tb):
        print(f"Tearing down resources for: {self.params}")
        # Release resources, perform cleanup actions
        # Example: close the file, release the lock, disconnect from database

        if exc_type is not None:
            print(f"  Exception occurred: {exc_type.__name__}: {exc_value}")
            # Optionally handle the exception here
            # If you want to suppress the exception, return True
            # return True # Suppresses the exception

        # If not suppressing, the exception (if any) will be re-raised automatically
        # Returning False or None (implicitly) allows exceptions to propagate
        return False
```

**Example: File Manager (from GeeksforGeeks & Real Python)**
A common example is a `FileManager` that ensures a file is closed.
```python
class FileManager:
    def __init__(self, filename, mode):
        self.filename = filename
        self.mode = mode
        self.file = None
        print(f"FileManager initialized for '{filename}' in '{mode}' mode.")

    def __enter__(self):
        print(f"Opening file '{self.filename}'...")
        self.file = open(self.filename, self.mode)
        return self.file # Return the file object to be used in the 'with' block

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, exc_tb):
        print(f"Closing file '{self.filename}'...")
        if self.file: # Check if file was successfully opened in __enter__
            self.file.close()
        if exc_type:
            print(f"  An exception of type {exc_type.__name__} occurred: {exc_value}")
        # By default, returns None, so exceptions are not suppressed
        # return False # Explicitly do not suppress
```
**Usage:**
```python
with FileManager('example.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('This is a test.\n')
    # f.write(123) # This would cause a TypeError

# f is guaranteed to be closed here.
print(f"Is file closed? {f.closed}") # Output: Is file closed? True
```
This class-based approach is robust for managing resources that require state (like the `self.file` object) or more complex setup/teardown logic. It clearly separates the resource management concerns from the code that uses the resource.
