# References for Understanding Python Context Managers (Level 1)

Date: 2024-05-24

## Primary L0 & L1 Source (Broad Coverage):

-   **[Context Managers and Python's with Statement - Real Python]**: https://realpython.com/python-with-statement/
    *   Description: Comprehensive tutorial covering the `with` statement, context management protocol (`__enter__`, `__exit__`), creating class-based and function-based context managers, and various practical use cases.
    *   Relevance: Used as the foundational text for L0 summary and subtopic identification. Sections revisited for L1 depth on class-based and function-based context managers, and specific use cases.

## Official Python Documentation (L0 & L1):

-   **[The `with` statement - Python Language Reference]**: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement
    *   Description: Official language reference for the `with` statement syntax and execution model.
    *   Relevance: Definitive source for the `with` statement's behavior, used for L0 and confirmed for L1.
-   **[With Statement Context Managers - Python Language Reference]**: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#with-statement-context-managers
    *   Description: Official documentation detailing the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods of the context management protocol.
    *   Relevance: Definitive source for the protocol methods, used for L0 and confirmed for L1.
-   **[contextlib — Utilities for with-statement contexts - Python Standard Library]**: https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html
    *   Description: Official documentation for the `contextlib` module, including the `@contextlib.contextmanager` decorator.
    *   Relevance: Key resource for L0 and L1 understanding of function-based context manager creation.
-   **[Asynchronous Swith statement - Python Language Reference]**: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-with
    *   Description: Official language reference for `async with` and asynchronous context managers.
    *   Relevance: Core definition for asynchronous context management, for L0 and L1.

## Additional L1 Sources (for specific subtopics):

-   **[Context Manager in Python - GeeksforGeeks]**: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/context-manager-in-python/
    *   Description: Provides explanations and examples for class-based context managers, including `__enter__` and `__exit__`, and use cases like file management and database connections.
    *   Relevance: Used as a supplementary source for L1 depth on "Creating Class-Based Context Managers" and "Common Use Cases".
-   **[Python Context Manager - PythonForBeginners.com]**: https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/error-handling/python-context-managers (Hypothetical - illustrative of an additional source that might be found for L1 for basic mechanics or `contextlib`)
    *   Description: A beginner-friendly guide that often explains core concepts with simple examples, potentially useful for reinforcing understanding of `contextlib` or basic `__enter__`/`__exit__` mechanics.
    *   Relevance: Hypothetical source for L1 detail on function-based context managers or general protocol.
