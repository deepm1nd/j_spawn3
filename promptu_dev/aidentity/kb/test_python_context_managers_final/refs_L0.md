## Main Overview & Multiple Subtopics:

-   **[Context Managers and Python's with Statement - Real Python]**: https://realpython.com/python-with-statement/
    *   Description: Comprehensive tutorial covering the `with` statement, context management protocol (`__enter__`, `__exit__`), creating class-based and function-based context managers, and various practical use cases including file handling, lock management, and asynchronous context managers.
    *   Relevance: Primary source for the L0 detailed overview and initial explanations for many subtopics.

## Specific Protocol/Syntax Details:

-   **[The `with` statement - Python Language Reference]**: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement
    *   Description: Official language reference for the `with` statement syntax and execution model.
    *   Relevance: Core definition of the `with` statement.
-   **[With Statement Context Managers - Python Language Reference]**: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#with-statement-context-managers
    *   Description: Official documentation detailing the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods of the context management protocol.
    *   Relevance: Definitive source for the protocol methods.
-   **[contextlib — Utilities for with-statement contexts - Python Standard Library]**: https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html
    *   Description: Official documentation for the `contextlib` module, including the `@contextlib.contextmanager` decorator for creating function-based context managers.
    *   Relevance: Key resource for function-based context manager creation.
-   **[Asynchronous Swith statement - Python Language Reference]**: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-with
    *   Description: Official language reference for the `async with` statement and asynchronous context managers (`__aenter__`, `__aexit__`).
    *   Relevance: Core definition for asynchronous context management.

## Supporting Concepts (Mentioned in Use Cases):

-   **[decimal — Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic - Python Standard Library]**: https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html
    *   Description: Documentation for the `decimal` module, relevant for the `localcontext()` use case.
    *   Relevance: Resource for understanding the `decimal.localcontext` example.
-   **[threading — Thread-based parallelism - Python Standard Library]**: https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html
    *   Description: Documentation for the `threading` module, relevant for `Lock` objects as context managers.
    *   Relevance: Resource for understanding the `threading.Lock` example.
-   **[pytest.raises - pytest documentation]**: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#pytest-raises
    *   Description: Documentation for `pytest.raises` used for testing exceptions, which can act as a context manager.
    *   Relevance: Resource for the exception testing use case.
