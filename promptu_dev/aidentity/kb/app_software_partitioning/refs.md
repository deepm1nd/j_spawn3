## Architectural Patterns for Partitioning

    *   Key Takeaways: Explains N-tier and three-tier architectures (layered architectures), common layers (presentation, application/business logic, data access), and how they promote separation of concerns and independent development of layers through defined interfaces.

    *   Key Takeaways: Defines CBSE, the concept of software components with provided and required interfaces, and its benefits for reusability, replaceability, and modularity.
*   **Wikipedia contributors. (2025, June 5). *Microservices*. In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.** Retrieved 08:53, June 5, 2025, from [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microservices&oldid=1294055745](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microservices&oldid=1294055745)
    *   Key Takeaways: Describes microservice architecture as a collection of small, autonomous, independently deployable services. Emphasizes communication via well-defined APIs (often HTTP/REST), decentralized data management, and independent scalability. Highlights the role of API Gateways.
*   **Wikipedia contributors. (2025, April 15). *Event-driven architecture*. In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.** Retrieved 11:48, April 15, 2025, from [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Event-driven_architecture&oldid=1285726056](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Event-driven_architecture&oldid=1285726056)
    *   Key Takeaways: Explains EDA as a paradigm where components (producers, consumers) react to events. Highlights loose coupling, asynchronous communication, and the role of event channels (message brokers). Event schemas act as the interface.
*   **Wikipedia contributors. (2025, May 23). *Domain-driven design*. In Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.** Retrieved 12:15, May 23, 2025, from [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domain-driven_design&oldid=1291787813](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domain-driven_design&oldid=1291787813)
    *   Key Takeaways: Focuses on modeling software to match a business domain. Introduces Strategic DDD concepts like Bounded Contexts and Context Mapping (Anticorruption Layer, Open-Host Service, Published Language) as ways to partition a large system and define interfaces between these partitions. Tactical DDD (Aggregates, Entities, Services, Repositories) defines interfaces within a bounded context.

## General API Design and Interface Management (Context)

*   The principles discussed in the "Interface-Based Design Best Practices - L1" research (located in `promptu_dev/kb/interface_based_design_best_practices/expert_L1.md`) are foundational:
    *   Microsoft Docs. *Best practices for RESTful web API design*.
    *   OpenAPI Initiative.
    *   These cover general API design, REST principles, versioning, and contract definition, which are essential for managing interfaces between partitioned application components, especially for microservices and other distributed architectures.
*   Language-specific interface mechanisms (e.g., Java interfaces/packages/JPMS, Rust traits/modules/crates) detailed in their respective partitioning KBs (`promptu_dev/kb/java_software_partitioning/` and `promptu_dev/kb/rust_software_partitioning/`) provide the tools to implement these architectural patterns.
