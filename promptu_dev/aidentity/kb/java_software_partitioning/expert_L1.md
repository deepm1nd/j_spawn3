## Content for: Packages and Access Modifiers

*(Building upon L0 explanation with significantly more detail)*

Java's package system, combined with its access modifiers, forms the foundational layer of software partitioning, primarily offering namespace management and compile-time visibility control. While JPMS provides stronger encapsulation, understanding packages remains crucial for organizing code within modules and in projects not yet migrated to JPMS.

**Core Concepts:**
-   **Namespace Management:** Packages are declared with the `package` keyword at the top of a Java source file (e.g., `package com.example.myapp.feature;`). They group related classes and interfaces, preventing naming conflicts across different parts of an application. The file system layout conventionally mirrors the package structure (e.g., `com/example/myapp/feature/MyClass.java`). This hierarchical naming helps organize code into logical domains.
-   **Compilation Units:** Typically, each `.java` source file is a compilation unit. The package declaration determines which package the types defined in that file belong to.

**Access Modifiers and Their Role in Interface Definition:**
Java provides four access levels, which determine the visibility of classes and their members (fields, methods, nested types) across different packages and classes. This is key to defining what constitutes the public API of a package versus its internal implementation.
1.  **`public`:**
    *   A `public` class or interface is visible to all classes in all packages, provided its containing module (if any) exports its package.
    *   `public` members (fields, methods, constructors, nested types) are accessible from any code that can access the class/interface itself.
    *   **Interface Implication:** `public` interfaces and their `public` methods form the primary contract for inter-package and inter-module communication. They are essential for broadly usable APIs.
2.  **Package-Private (Default - no modifier):**
    *   If a top-level class, interface, or member is declared without an access modifier, it is package-private.
    *   It is visible only to classes and interfaces within the *same package*.
    *   **Interface Implication:** Package-private interfaces or classes can define contracts and collaborations *within* a logical grouping (the package) without exposing these details to external packages. This is a form of encapsulation at the package level, often used for helper classes or internal framework structures that should not be part of the public API of that package or module.
3.  **`protected`:**
    *   `protected` members are accessible within their own package and by subclasses in other packages (even if those subclasses are in different modules, provided the containing class is accessible).
    *   `protected` access is specifically tied to inheritance. It allows a superclass to provide extension points for subclasses while keeping those points hidden from unrelated classes.
    *   **Interface Implication:** While interfaces themselves cannot be `protected`, `protected` methods in abstract or concrete classes that implement interfaces can be part of a framework designed for extension by subclassing.
4.  **`private`:**
    *   `private` members are accessible only within the same top-level class in which they are declared.
    *   **Interface Implication:** Ensures that implementation details of a class are fully hidden, providing the strongest form of encapsulation. This is crucial for maintaining invariants and allowing internal refactoring without affecting any external code, even within the same package.

**Best Practices for Partitioning with Packages:**
-   **High Cohesion:** Group classes and interfaces with closely related responsibilities and functionalities into the same package. A package should represent a distinct logical unit or domain concept.
-   **Low Coupling:** Minimize dependencies between packages. Interactions should ideally occur through well-defined `public` interfaces of other packages. Avoid reaching into the internal (package-private) classes of other packages.
-   **API Definition:** Clearly distinguish between public API (intended for external consumers) and internal implementation. Use `public` judiciously for types and members that form the stable, external API of a package/module. Default to package-private for internal details and collaborations within the package.
-   **Avoid Cyclic Dependencies:** Cycles between packages make the system harder to understand, test, build, and maintain. Tools like JDepend can help analyze package dependencies.
-   **Naming Conventions:** Adhere to standard Java naming conventions (e.g., reverse domain name for package prefixes like `com.example.project.feature`).

While packages provide a good first level of organization, they lack true "strong encapsulation" in the sense that there's no mechanism to prevent code in one package from accessing `public` types in another arbitrary package on the classpath (unless restricted by classloader visibility or, more robustly, by JPMS). They also don't define explicit dependencies between packages, which JPMS addresses.

## Content for: Java Platform Module System (JPMS) - Project Jigsaw

*(Building upon L0 explanation with significantly more detail)*

The Java Platform Module System (JPMS), introduced in Java 9 (Project Jigsaw), represents a significant advancement in Java's software partitioning capabilities. It provides stronger encapsulation and more reliable configuration than was possible with just packages and the classpath.

**Core Concepts & `module-info.java` Deep Dive:**
A module is a named, self-describing collection of code (packages) and data. Its properties are defined in a module descriptor file, `module-info.java`, located at the root of the module's source code. This file is compiled into `module-info.class`.

-   **`module <module.name> { ... }`**: Defines the module. Module names should be globally unique, typically following reverse-DNS naming (e.g., `com.example.datamodel`).
-   **`requires <dependency.module.name>;`**: Declares a compile-time and runtime dependency. The current module can access types from *exported* packages of the `dependency.module.name`.
-   **`requires transitive <dependency.module.name>;` (Implied Readability):** If module A `requires transitive` B, and module C `requires` A, then module C also implicitly reads module B. This is crucial when module A's public API includes types from module B. For example, if `com.example.applogic` `requires transitive com.example.model` and `com.example.ui` `requires com.example.applogic`, then `com.example.ui` can also directly use public types from exported packages of `com.example.model`.
-   **`requires static <dependency.module.name>;` (Optional Dependencies):** The dependency is mandatory at compile-time but optional at runtime. The module using this must check for the presence of the optional module (e.g., via `Optional<Module>` or by catching `NoClassDefFoundError` / `ClassNotFoundException` for types from the optional module) and adapt its behavior accordingly.
-   **`exports <package.name>;`**: Makes all `public` types (and their `public` and `protected` members) within the specified `<package.name>` of the current module accessible to any other module that `requires` it. Packages *not* exported are strongly encapsulated; their types (even `public` ones) are inaccessible from outside the module.
-   **`exports <package.name> to <specific.module1>, <specific.module2>;` (Qualified Exports):** Restricts the export of `<package.name>` exclusively to the listed modules. This allows for creating internal APIs shared between specific modules without exposing them to all modules.
-   **`opens <package.name>;`**: Allows all types (public and non-public) and their members within `<package.name>` to be accessed via reflection at runtime by code in *any* other module. This is often necessary for frameworks that perform deep reflection.
-   **`opens <package.name> to <specific.module1>, <specific.module2>;` (Qualified Opens):** Restricts reflective access to `<package.name>` to only the specified modules.
-   **`uses <service.interface.FullName>;`**: Declares that the current module consumes a service defined by the given interface (or abstract class). The module will use `java.util.ServiceLoader` to discover and load implementations of this service provided by other modules.
-   **`provides <service.interface.FullName> with <implementation.class.FullName>;`**: Declares that the current module provides an implementation (`implementation.class.FullName`) for the specified service interface. This implementation class must be public and have a public no-arg constructor.

**Benefits for Partitioning & API Design:**
1.  **Strong Encapsulation & Reliable APIs:** JPMS enforces that only explicitly exported packages are accessible outside a module. This "encapsulation by default" for non-exported packages prevents unintended dependencies on internal implementation details, making APIs more robust and maintainable.
2.  **Reliable Configuration & Modularity:**
    *   **Explicit Dependencies:** The module system validates the module graph at compile-time and runtime, ensuring all `requires` directives are satisfied. This leads to earlier detection of missing modules or version incompatibilities (though JPMS itself doesn't handle versioning, it works with build tools that do).
    *   **No Split Packages (for exported packages):** A package cannot be present in multiple modules if those modules are read by the same dependent module, preventing ambiguity.
3.  **Scalable Platform (`jlink`):** Enables the creation of custom runtime images containing only the necessary application and JDK modules, significantly reducing application footprint.
4.  **Clear Service Decoupling:** The `uses` and `provides` directives integrate the `ServiceLoader` mechanism directly into the module system, making it a first-class concept for building extensible and loosely coupled applications.

**Module Path and Types of Modules:**
-   **Module Path:** A sequence of directories and/or module JARs that the module system searches to resolve modules.
-   **Explicit Modules:** JARs containing a `module-info.class` file.
-   **Automatic Modules:** Regular JARs (without `module-info.class`) placed on the module path. They automatically export all their packages and read all other modules. Their module name is derived from the JAR filename (with version information stripped and non-alphanumeric characters replaced by dots).
-   **Unnamed Module:** Represents all code loaded from the classpath. It reads all other modules by default. This provides a migration path for legacy applications.

**Best Practices:**
-   Design modules with high cohesion and low coupling.
-   Export only packages that form the intended public API.
-   Use `requires transitive` judiciously to avoid exposing unnecessary modules.
-   Leverage `uses` and `provides` for service decoupling.
-   Consider module naming conventions carefully (e.g., `com.example.feature`).
