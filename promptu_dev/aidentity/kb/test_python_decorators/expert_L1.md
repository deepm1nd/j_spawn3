## Content for: Basic Decorator Syntax (`@`) and Mechanics

Python decorators offer a concise and readable way to modify or enhance functions and methods. The core mechanism relies on functions being first-class objects, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions and returned from them.

A decorator is itself a callable (usually a function) that takes one function (the one being decorated) as an argument and returns a new function (or a modified version of the original). This returned function, often called a "wrapper" function, typically contains logic to execute before and/or after the original function call.

The `@decorator_name` syntax placed directly above a function definition is syntactic sugar for the assignment `function_to_decorate = decorator_name(function_to_decorate)`.

**Example (Conceptual):**
```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs) # Call the original function
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    return f"Greeting for {name}"

# This is equivalent to:
# say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)

say_hello("Alice")
```
In this structure, `my_decorator` receives `say_hello` as `func`. It defines `wrapper`, which then calls the original `say_hello` (referenced as `func`) and adds behavior around it. The name `say_hello` is then rebound to the `wrapper` function. The use of `*args` and `**kwargs` in the wrapper ensures that it can decorate functions with any signature.

Understanding closures is also key: the `wrapper` function has access to `func` (the original decorated function) even after `my_decorator` has finished executing, because `func` is in its enclosing scope.

This mechanism allows for concerns like logging, timing, access control, etc., to be separated from the core logic of the function being decorated.

## Content for: Using `functools.wraps` to Preserve Metadata

When a function is decorated, its original metadata (like its name `__name__`, docstring `__doc__`, module `__module__`, annotations `__annotations__`, and qualified name `__qualname__`) is replaced by the metadata of the wrapper function. This can make debugging and introspection difficult.

The `functools` module provides a decorator called `@functools.wraps` to address this. When applied to the wrapper function inside a decorator, `@functools.wraps` copies the relevant attributes from the original (wrapped) function to the wrapper function.

**Example:**
```python
import functools

def logging_decorator(func):
    @functools.wraps(func) # Apply wraps to the wrapper
    def wrapper_logging(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__} with arguments: {args}, {kwargs}")
        value = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"{func.__name__} returned: {value}")
        return value
    return wrapper_logging

@logging_decorator
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """This function adds two numbers."""
    return a + b

print(add_numbers.__name__) # Output: add_numbers (without @wraps, it would be wrapper_logging)
print(add_numbers.__doc__)  # Output: This function adds two numbers. (without @wraps, it would be None or wrapper's doc)
```
By using `@functools.wraps(func)` on `wrapper_logging`, the `add_numbers` function, even after being decorated, retains its original name and docstring. This is crucial for maintaining clear APIs, generating accurate documentation, and aiding in debugging. The `update_wrapper()` function is the underlying mechanism used by `@wraps` to perform these updates and also sets a `__wrapped__` attribute on the wrapper that points to the original function.

## Content for: Common Use Cases: Logging

Decorators are frequently used to add logging capabilities to functions without cluttering the core logic of the function itself. This promotes separation of concerns. A logging decorator typically wraps a function call, logs information about the call (e.g., function name, arguments, execution time, return value) before and/or after the function executes.

**Detailed Example - Logging Arguments and Return Values:**
```python
import functools
import logging

# Configure basic logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def log_calls(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper_log_calls(*args, **kwargs):
        args_repr = [repr(a) for a in args]
        kwargs_repr = [f"{k}={v!r}" for k, v in kwargs.items()]
        signature = ", ".join(args_repr + kwargs_repr)
        logging.info(f"Calling {func.__name__}({signature})")
        try:
            value = func(*args, **kwargs)
            logging.info(f"{func.__name__} returned {value!r}")
            return value
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Exception in {func.__name__}: {e}", exc_info=True)
            raise
    return wrapper_log_calls

@log_calls
def process_data(data_id, user="guest"):
    """Simulates processing some data."""
    print(f"Processing data for {data_id} by user {user}.")
    if data_id < 0:
        raise ValueError("Data ID cannot be negative.")
    return {"status": "processed", "id": data_id}

process_data(101, user="admin")
try:
    process_data(-1)
except ValueError:
    pass # Expected
```
In this example, the `log_calls` decorator logs the function name, its arguments before the call, and its return value (or any exception raised) after the call. This provides a clear audit trail of function invocations, which is invaluable for debugging and monitoring application behavior. The use of `repr()` for arguments and return values helps in getting a more unambiguous string representation of the objects. Logging exceptions with `exc_info=True` also includes stack trace information.
This approach ensures that the `process_data` function remains focused on its core task, while the logging concern is handled separately by the decorator.
