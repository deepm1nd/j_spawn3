**Feature/Project Implementation Status Report (from `promptu_dev/dev/`)**

1.  **Agentiq Knowledge Base Indexing System:**
    *   **Description:** A system to index various KB data types (`_expert.md`, `_refs.md`, `master_domain_log.md`, etc.) for advanced search capabilities (keyword, semantic, faceted, graph Q&A).
    *   **Source File:** `agentiq_indexing_scope_and_requirements.md`
    *   **Status:** **Planned/Design Phase.** Requirements are documented, and a research report is complete. Handoff notes indicate further work is pending more KB content.
    *   **Evidence:** Document is a specification. Handoff note from 2025-06-05.

2.  **Reorganization of `core_planning_instructions.txt` (CPI):**
    *   **Description:** Proposal for reorganizing the main CPI file, with options A (Chronological), B (Thematic), and C (Hybrid).
    *   **Source File:** `ai_context_categories.md`
    *   **Status:** **Proposed/Needs Decision.** `promptu_do.txt` lists this as needing a decision.
    *   **Evidence:** Document is a proposal. Item in `promptu_do.txt`.

3.  **MPS Framework Enhancements:**
    *   **Description:** A list of brainstormed features for the Master Prompt Segment framework.
        *   Standardized Error Handling Add-on: **Planned.**
        *   Inter-Task Data Exchange Protocol: **Planned.**
        *   Enhanced Task Progress Metrics: **Planned.**
        *   Automated Test Stub Generation Guidance: **Planned.**
        *   'Criticality' or 'Priority' Field for Tasks: **Planned.**
        *   Configurable Add-on Stack: **Implemented** (per note in source file, MPS v0.3.2).
        *   Resource Requirement Hints for Tasks: **Planned.**
        *   Project Glossary / Key Terms Generation: **Planned.**
    *   **Source File:** `feature_enhancements.md`
    *   **Status:** Mixed (see above). Most are planned/brainstormed ideas.
    *   **Evidence:** Notes within `feature_enhancements.md`.

4.  **Fork-Swarm-Join Task Planning Concept:**
    *   **Description:** A "Mothertask AI" orchestrating Worker AIs in phases for complex software development. Includes proposals to extend `task_spawning_addon.txt` for the Mothertask role.
    *   **Source File:** `fork_swarm_join_task_planning.md`
    *   **Status:** **Design/Proposal Phase.** Handoff notes (2025-06-04) confirm this is a new concept under investigation and design.
    *   **Evidence:** Document content and handoff notes.

5.  **Agentiq Frame of Reference (FoR) Concept:**
    *   **Description:** A conceptual framework for "Agentiq" as a Promptu Application to provide an AI with persistent and evolving FoR (Recall, Rules, Workflows, Chat Behaviors, Domain Knowledge including Leveled Research Protocol).
    *   **Source File:** `frame_of_reference_concept.md`
    *   **Status:** **Conceptual Design Phase.** Document is a "DRAFT." Some underlying mechanics (handoff, manifest-based directives) exist in Promptu, but "Agentiq" as a holistic app is conceptual.
    *   **Evidence:** Document content.

6.  **Instance Identity Framework (V1):**
    *   **Description:** Defines `AIdentity` model (Agni, Kavia), `aidentity_context.json` profile, startup workflow, Todo/Tickler systems, and communication protocols.
    *   **Source File:** `framework_instance_identity.md`
    *   **Status:** **Partially Implemented/In Progress.**
        *   `aidentity_context.json` exists and is used.
        *   The CPI processing aligns significantly with the startup workflow.
        *   Some communication protocols are implemented as Traits.
        *   Basic Todo/Tickler files exist.
    *   **Evidence:** Comparison of design doc with existing files (`aidentity_context.json`, CPI, traits) and handoff notes.

7.  **Promptu Updater (PU) / Promptu Package Archive (PPA) System:**
    *   **Description:** A feature to transfer framework components (add-ons, apps, guidelines) between Promptu instances using update packages (`.ppa`). Involves an `apply_promptu_update` add-on or new IEPs (`CREATE_PROMPTU_PACKAGE`, `APPLY_PROMPTU_PACKAGE`).
    *   **Source Files:** `implement_mps_updater.txt`, `prompt_for_implementing_ppa_system.txt`
    *   **Status:** **Planned/To Be Implemented.** Both source files are prompts for future implementation tasks.
    *   **Evidence:** Content of the source files.

8.  **Operational Directives Management (Manifest-Based System):**
    *   **Description:** Proposal C for managing operational directives (rules, guidelines, preferences) as individual files in libraries, activated by a manifest.
    *   **Source File:** `operating_rules_management_proposal.txt`
    *   **Status:** **Largely Implemented/In Progress.** The active use of `active_manifest.json` and `promptu_dev/core/traits/` files, along with CPI Section V.A, aligns with this proposal. A todo in `promptu_do.txt` about deciding on this might be outdated.
    *   **Evidence:** Current framework structure, CPI content.

9.  **Various Todos from `promptu_do.txt`:**
    *   **Description & Status:**
        *   Handoff Note Crash Resilience: **Planned.**
        *   Develop System for Complex Shorthands: **Planned.**
        *   Apply Doc Formatting Guideline B.10: **Planned.**
        *   Shorthand 'SH: SideTask': **Planned.**
        *   Universal 'batch task processing' behavior: **Planned.**
        *   Guideline: AI to follow 'Automatic Todo Detection': **Implemented Guideline/Ongoing AI Behavior.**
        *   Guideline: Research Task logging unprocessable files: **Planned Guideline.**
        *   Strategy: Revisit `pre_promptu.txt` role: **Planned Discussion.**
    *   **Source File:** `promptu_do.txt`
    *   **Evidence:** Content of `promptu_do.txt`.
