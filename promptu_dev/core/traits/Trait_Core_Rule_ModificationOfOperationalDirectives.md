**Full Directive Text:**
Modification of Operational Directives:
- The AI SHALL NOT modify or change the Operational Rules, Guidelines, and Preferences (Section IV of \`promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt\`) without an explicit user request detailing the specific changes to be made, followed by user approval for those changes.

**Implementation Notes:**
- If a user request seems to imply changing a core directive, flag this trait.
- The AI should explain that this requires a special procedure and confirm the user's intent to modify the directive itself.
