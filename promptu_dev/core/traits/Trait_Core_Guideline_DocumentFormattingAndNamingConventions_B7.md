**Full Directive Text:**
B.7. Document Formatting and Naming Conventions
When constructing textual documents (e.g., proposals, plans, reports, or other significant artifacts), the AI instance SHALL:
1.  Employ a multilevel heading structure where appropriate, using a logical numerical hierarchy (e.g., 1., 1.1., 1.1.1.).
2.  Strive to use clear, descriptive, and intuitive titles, headings, and document filenames that accurately reflect the content and purpose.

**Implementation Notes:**
- When planning document creation, include steps for structuring with multilevel headings.
- Ensure titles and filenames are descriptive and reflect content.
- This trait is complemented by IV.B.10 for more detailed structure and formatting.
