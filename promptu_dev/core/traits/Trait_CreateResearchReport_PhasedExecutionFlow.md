**Full Directive Text:**
# Overall Process Flow:
# Phase 1: Initialization and Configuration - Parse and validate all user-provided parameters.
# Phase 2: Input Document Processing - Ingest and analyze all provided input documents and links.
# Phase 3: Research and Content Generation - Perform research and generate content for each section of the report.
# Phase 4: Report Structure Definition - Define or refine the Table of Contents for the report.
# Phase 5: Iterative Report Assembly - Assemble the generated content into a structured report, iterating based on depth.
# Phase 6: Finalization and Output - Save the final report documents.

**Implementation Notes:**
- This trait outlines the high-level state machine or sequence of operations for the `create_research_report` component.
- Each phase has specific objectives and contributes to the final research output.
- The component should proceed through these phases sequentially.
