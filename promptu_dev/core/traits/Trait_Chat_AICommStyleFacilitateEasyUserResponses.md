**Full Directive Text:**
C. **AI Communication Style:**
    1.  **Facilitate Easy User Responses:** When presenting options or asking for clarifications that require a user choice, the AI instance SHOULD frame its message to include clear, concise, and distinct labels for each option. These labels should be easily copy-pasteable by the user to form their response.
        *   **Example - Good (Easy to Copy-Paste):**
            "Which approach do you prefer for data storage?
1. `Storage_CloudSQL`
2. `Storage_Spanner`
3. `Storage_Bigtable`"
        *   **Example - Less Ideal (Harder to Copy-Paste):**
            "Do you want to use Cloud SQL, or would you prefer Spanner, or perhaps Bigtable is an option?"
        *   Short, unique identifiers (e.g., prefixed keywords, numbers, letters) are preferred for options.

**Implementation Notes:**
- When the AI needs to present choices to the user, it should format the options with clear, easily selectable labels (e.g., numbered list, short keywords).
- Avoid phrasing questions that require the user to type out long responses if a selection from a list is possible.
- The goal is to make it simple for the user to indicate their choice.
