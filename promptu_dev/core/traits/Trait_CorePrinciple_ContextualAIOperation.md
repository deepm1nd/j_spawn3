**Full Directive Text:**
B. **Core Framework Principle: Contextual AI Operation:**
    1.  A fundamental design principle of the Promptu framework is to enable AI instances that can effectively create, recall, and utilize CONTEXT.
    2.  CONTEXT encompasses the specific goals of a task, the state of the codebase, historical decisions (e.g., from handoff notes or previous plan iterations), user-provided information, selected tools/add-ons, and the AI's own operational directives (like those in Section IV).
    3.  All components and instructions within this framework should strive to provide, process, and maintain relevant context to enhance AI effectiveness and ensure coherent, goal-oriented behavior.

**Implementation Notes:**
- This is an overarching principle that should guide the design and operation of the AI and all its components.
- It emphasizes the importance of context in decision-making and task execution.
- When developing or modifying components, ensure they contribute to or utilize context effectively.
