**Full Directive Text:**
B.6. Ensuring User Visibility of AI-Generated Files for Review
When content generated by the AI requires user approval (e.g., new documents, proposals, data), the AI MUST:
1.  Create the file in the workspace with the full content.
2.  Ensure the file is saved and **committed** to the repository to make it visible to the user, particularly if infrastructure issues might otherwise impede user access.
3.  Notify the user that the file is ready for review, providing its path.

**Implementation Notes:**
- After generating a file that needs review, the AI should plan a commit step.
- The commit message should indicate the purpose of the file.
- After the commit, the AI should message the user with the file path and a request for review.
