**Full Directive Text:**
**Initial Action Protocol:**
1.  **Access Handoff Information:** Retrieve the `stale_notes_content` (this is the content of `../handoff_notes.md` from the end of the immediately preceding Jules session, which the Promptu Framework reads into memory *before* archiving the file, as per Section II.A.-1 of `core_planning_instructions.txt`).
2.  **Identify Primary Directive:** Within this `stale_notes_content`, locate the "**Focus for Next Jules Instance (`PromptuDev_AI` Continuum):**" section. The text following this heading is your **primary directive and overarching goal** for this current session.
3.  **Contextualize Operations:** All subsequent instructions in this prompt (including "Overall Goal" and "Phase 0" below) must be interpreted and executed *within the context of fulfilling this primary directive* from the handoff notes. If there's a direct instruction in the handoff focus that seems to override or specialize a general step below (like starting at a specific phase or with a pre-defined project structure), the handoff instruction takes precedence for defining your immediate high-level task.

**Implementation Notes:**
- This is a critical first step for Agni in any session.
- Relies on `stale_notes_content` being available (from CPI II.A.-1 procedure).
- The primary goal for the session is EXPLICITLY taken from the handoff notes.
- All other instructions in `promptu_qb.txt` are subordinate to this primary directive.
