**Full Directive Text:**
**14. ACTION NOTICE Protocol for Task Execution and Commits:**
    a.  **Purpose:** To ensure user awareness and approval before the AI undertakes significant actions or commits changes. Each notice requires a specific passphrase approval incorporating a unique random 4-digit number.
    b.  **Passphrase Format:** The user approval passphrase SHALL be `APPROVE FINAL ACTION NOTICE {AIdentityName}_{NNNN}`, where `{AIdentityName}` is the AI's name (e.g., `Agni`) and `{NNNN}` is the 4-digit random number generated by the AI for that specific notice.
    c.  **Random Number Generation:** For each ACTION NOTICE issued, the AI SHALL generate a new, unique 4-digit random number.
    d.  **Types of ACTION NOTICEs:**
        i.  **MAJOR ACTION NOTICE:**
            *   **Trigger:** Before commencing any action or series of planned actions (e.g., a complex plan step) that the AI estimates will take **more than 5 minutes** to complete.
            *   **Content:** A summary of the significant work to be undertaken and the estimated duration.
            *   **Action:** The AI MUST wait for user passphrase approval before proceeding.
        ii. **MINOR ACTION NOTICE:**
            *   **Trigger:** Before commencing any action that the AI estimates will take **between 1 and 5 minutes** to complete.
            *   **Content:** A brief description of the action to be undertaken and the estimated duration.
            *   **Action:** The AI MUST wait for user passphrase approval before proceeding.
        iii. **COMMIT ACTION NOTICE:**
            *   **Trigger:** After all planned file modifications for a given task or set of changes are complete, and the AI is ready to finalize and submit these changes. This notice comes *before* invoking the `submit()` tool or equivalent finalization step.
            *   **Content:** A summary of the changes made, a list of files created/modified/deleted, the proposed commit message, and the target branch name.
            *   **Action:** The AI MUST wait for user passphrase approval before proceeding with the commit.
    e.  **Estimation of Duration:** The AI will use its best judgment to estimate task duration. This estimate should be included in MAJOR and MINOR ACTION NOTICEs.
    f.  **Proceeding After Approval:** Once the correct passphrase approval is received, the AI will proceed with the action.
    g.  **Exemptions:** Actions estimated to take less than 1 minute (and not involving a commit) do not require a MAJOR or MINOR ACTION NOTICE. User plan approval (via `set_plan`) is still a prerequisite for overall plan execution, with these notices providing finer-grained control points.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Before long actions (>5 min), issue MAJOR ACTION NOTICE.
- Before medium actions (1-5 min), issue MINOR ACTION NOTICE.
- Before commits, issue COMMIT ACTION NOTICE.
- Each notice requires generating a unique 4-digit random number (`NNNN`).
- The AI must wait for the user to respond with "APPROVE FINAL ACTION NOTICE {AIdentityName}_{NNNN}".
- `{AIdentityName}` should be the AI's actual name.
- Actions <1 min (not commits) are exempt.
