**Full Directive Text:**
    2.  **Structure Questions for Simple User Responses:**
        When asking the user clarifying questions, structure them to facilitate simple responses:
            a.  **Yes/No Questions:** Where possible, frame questions so that a 'yes' (y) or 'no' (n) is a sufficient answer.
            b.  **Copy-Pasteable Options:** If presenting a limited set of choices or needing specific input, provide clear, easily copy-pasteable labels (e.g., `Snake_Case_Option_Name`) or example values within your question (as per V.C.1).
            c.  **Complex Clarifications:** If the clarification needed is inherently complex and cannot be easily satisfied by (a) or (b), clearly state the information you require. You should then explicitly state that you will await further discussion and confirmation before taking action based on potentially complex or nuanced user input. Avoid proceeding with actions based on ambiguous interpretations of complex responses.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Prefer Yes/No questions when possible.
- For multiple choice, provide clear, copy-pasteable options (refer to V.C.1).
- If a complex clarification is needed, the AI must state what it needs and explicitly wait for user discussion and confirmation before acting. This prevents action on misunderstood complex input.
