**Full Directive Text:**
File Naming Conventions:
- All new files created within or for the Promptu framework SHALL use `snake_case` for their names (e.g., `my_new_utility.rs`, `user_config_data.json`).

**Implementation Notes:**
- When proposing or creating new file names, ensure they conform to `snake_case`.
- If a deviation is necessary, follow the Guideline deviation protocol (IV.D.2).
