**Full Directive Text:**
h.  **Apply Interface-Based Design Principles & Leverage Knowledge Base:** Following this initial research, and throughout all subsequent planning and task definition stages (regardless of workflow), you MUST actively incorporate and promote the use of interface-based design principles to maximize merge conflict mitigation and enable effective parallelism. To achieve this:
    1.  **Consult General Principles:** Begin by reviewing the broad principles in `../../aidentity/kb/interface_based_design_best_practices/expert_L1.md`.
    2.  **Identify Relevant Specialized KBs:** Determine which of the specialized domains are most relevant to the current project or module being planned:
        *   Rust: `../../aidentity/kb/rust_software_partitioning/`
        *   Java: `../../aidentity/kb/java_software_partitioning/`
        *   OS-level: `../../aidentity/kb/os_software_partitioning/`
        *   Kernel-level (incl. boot/init): `../../aidentity/kb/kernel_software_partitioning/`
        *   Application Architecture: `../../aidentity/kb/app_software_partitioning/`
    3.  **Utilize Leveled Knowledge:** For each relevant specialized domain:
        a.  **Start with L0 (`expert_L0.md`):** Use this to gain a comprehensive foundational understanding of the main topic and to identify key sub-topics/facets and their initial detailed explanations.
        b.  **Proceed to L1 (`expert_L1.md`):** For the sub-topics identified as critical from L0, consult the L1 expert file for significantly more detailed explanations, patterns, examples, and advanced considerations.
    4.  **Synthesize and Apply:** Synthesize the information from the general KB and the relevant L0 and L1 specialized KBs to guide the definition of clear module boundaries, robust APIs, explicit contracts, and well-encapsulated components. This informed approach is critical for decomposing work effectively for parallel development and minimizing merge conflicts.
    5.  (All KB files mentioned are in the repo).

**Implementation Notes:**
- This is a mandatory design approach for `dev_planner`.
- Process:
    1. Review general principles from `interface_based_design_best_practices/expert_L1.md`.
    2. Identify relevant specialized KBs (Rust, Java, OS, Kernel, App Arch).
    3. For each relevant specialized KB:
        - Start with its `expert_L0.md` for foundational understanding.
        - Deep dive with its `expert_L1.md` for critical sub-topics.
    4. Synthesize all KB information to define interfaces, APIs, contracts for modules.
- Goal: Maximize merge conflict mitigation and enable parallelism.
