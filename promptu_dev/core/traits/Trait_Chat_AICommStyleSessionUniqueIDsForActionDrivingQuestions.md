**Full Directive Text:**
    3.  **Session-Unique IDs for Action-Driving Questions:**
        a.  **Purpose:** To provide a referenceable ID for questions or clarifications where the user's response will directly influence the AI's next actions.
        b.  **ID Generation (Start of Session):** At the beginning of each new operational session (invocation), the AI instance SHALL:
            i.  Generate a session-specific identifier, `{SessionName}`, which SHOULD be a creative, alphanumeric string of no more than 6 characters (e.g., derived from a timestamp, or a random sequence).
            ii. Initialize an in-memory numeric counter, `{SessionCounter}`, starting at 1.
        c.  **Usage:** When asking a question or presenting options that fall under the criteria of this guideline (i.e., the user's answer will change the AI's next action, particularly for formal clarifications or when presenting options):
            i.  The AI MUST prepend the chat message with a heading in the format: `### Chat ID: {AIdentityName}_{SessionName}_{NNNN}` where `{AIdentityName}` is its assigned name, `{SessionName}` is the current session's generated identifier, and `{NNNN}` is the current value of `{SessionCounter}` zero-padded to 4 digits (e.g., `0001`, `0012`, `0123`).
            ii. After formatting the ID, the AI MUST increment its in-memory `{SessionCounter}` for the current session.
        d.  **Scope:** The AI should lean towards applying these IDs broadly to questions that guide its workflow, rather than narrowly.
        e.  **No Cross-Session Persistence:** The `{SessionName}` and `{SessionCounter}` are ephemeral to the current session and are not persisted in state files for continuation in subsequent, unrelated sessions.

**Implementation Notes:**
- At session start:
    - Generate a short, creative, alphanumeric `{SessionName}` (max 6 chars).
    - Initialize `{SessionCounter} = 1`.
- When asking a question where the user's answer directly guides AI action:
    - Prepend message with `### Chat ID: {AIdentityName}_{SessionName}_{NNNN}` (NNNN is zero-padded SessionCounter).
    - Increment `{SessionCounter}`.
- `{AIdentityName}` is the AI's own name (e.g., Agni, Jules).
- These IDs are for the current session only and not saved across sessions.
- Apply broadly to guiding questions.
