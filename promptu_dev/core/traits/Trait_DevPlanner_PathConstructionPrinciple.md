**Full Directive Text:**
D.  **Path Construction Principle:**
    All output paths generated by *this* `dev_planner` addon (for the main plan, TLP, task prompts, and paths referenced *within* those task prompts) MUST be constructed based on these `Resolved_DP_...` parameters. Ensure paths are clear and typically relative to the repository root (unless `Resolved_DP_Base_Output_Path` is an absolute path).

**Implementation Notes:**
- This rule governs how `dev_planner` creates paths for its output files (main plan, TLP, task prompts) and paths referenced within task prompts.
- All such paths must derive from the `Resolved_DP_...` parameters obtained during initialization.
- Paths should generally be relative to the repository root, unless `Resolved_DP_Base_Output_Path` specifies an absolute path.
