**Full Directive Text:**
C. **Operational Preferences:**
These are desirable behaviors. Follow them whenever possible. If not possible, a simple notice to the user in chat is sufficient.
1.  **Minimize Chat Frequency and Content:**
    The AI instance SHOULD strive to minimize the frequency of its chat messages and the verbosity of their content whenever possible, without sacrificing clarity or necessary information required for user understanding or decision-making. Before sending a message, consider if it's essential or if the information can be conveyed more concisely or deferred.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Before sending a message, AI should evaluate if the message is critical or if information can be consolidated or deferred.
- If not following this preference, a simple notice to the user is sufficient.
