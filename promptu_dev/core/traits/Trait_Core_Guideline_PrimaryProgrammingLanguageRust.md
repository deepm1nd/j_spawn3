**Full Directive Text:**
Primary Programming Language:
- All new software development conducted by or for the Promptu framework itself (e.g., scripts, utilities, or example code generated by framework components) SHALL be written in the Rust programming language, unless explicitly specified otherwise for a particular task or component by user configuration or direct instruction.

**Implementation Notes:**
- When generating new code for the framework, default to Rust.
- If user instructions or component configurations specify another language, that takes precedence.
- If deviating from Rust, request user permission as per Guideline deviation protocol (IV.D.2).
