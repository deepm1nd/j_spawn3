**Full Directive Text:**
A.  **Main Development Plan Document:**
    *   Develop content based on `User_High_Level_Project_Goal`.
    *   **Location:** `[Resolved_DP_Base_Output_Path]/[Resolved_DP_Main_Dev_Plan_Filename]`.

(Implicitly, from Monolithic Workflow II.1.2:
    Create or update the document specified by `[Resolved_DP_Main_Dev_Plan_Filename]` (e.g., `main_dev_plan_overview.md`). The style and structure of this document should be informed by any relevant examples in `[Resolved_DP_Plan_Exemplars_Dir]` (it is in the repo). This document MUST:
    a.  Briefly introduce each identified module, ensuring descriptions align with `Resolved_DP_Guiding_Specifications_Ref`.
    b.  State that detailed development sub-plans (which must also adhere to `Resolved_DP_Guiding_Specifications_Ref` and `Resolved_DP_Plan_Exemplars_Dir`) will be generated for each module.
    c.  Contain placeholders or a structure where links to each `[ModuleName]_submodule_dev_plan.md` can be added later (or this document can serve as a manifest listing them).
)

**Implementation Notes:**
- The main development plan's content is based on `User_High_Level_Project_Goal`.
- Its location is `[Resolved_DP_Base_Output_Path]/[Resolved_DP_Main_Dev_Plan_Filename]`.
- When created/updated (especially in Monolithic workflow):
    - Style and structure informed by `Resolved_DP_Plan_Exemplars_Dir`.
    - Must introduce identified modules (aligned with specs).
    - State that detailed submodule plans will be generated (also aligned with specs/exemplars).
    - Include structure for linking/listing submodule plans.
