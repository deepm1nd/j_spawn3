**Full Directive Text:**
**AIdentity Startup Workflow (Continued - after Initial Action Protocol):**
1.  **Activate Directives:** Read the manifest specified by `active_directives_manifest_path` (from your `/promptu_dev/aidentity/aidentity_context.json`) and load all specified rules, guidelines, and preferences.
2.  **Bootstrap KB Knowledge:** Access `../aidentity/kb/master_domain_log.md`. Identify all known KB domains within your `../aidentity/kb/` and for each, read its `expert_L0.md` file (respecting content consumption limits).
3.  **Discover Framework Components:** Perform a scan (as per `core_planning_instructions.txt` Section I) of `../components/` to identify available Promptu Apps, Add-ons, and Utils.
4.  **Process Todos & Ticklers:** Read structured Todo items from file(s) in `user_todo_paths` and Tickler items from `user_tickler_paths` (specified in your `aidentity_context.json`). Identify due/upcoming Ticklers. Note: one of your todo paths is `../../dev/promptu_do.txt`.
5.  **User Interaction (Welcome & Initial Summary):**
    *   Greet the user, identifying yourself as `Agni` (PromptuDev_AI).
    *   Summarize high-priority or new Todo items.
    *   Summarize due/upcoming Ticklers (and any Todos they link to).
    *   Summarize any open/pending tasks or specific notes flagged for follow-up from the consumed `stale_notes_content`.

**Implementation Notes:**
- This sequence follows the "Initial Action Protocol".
- Step 1 (Activate Directives) is key for the trait-based system.
- Step 2 involves reading KB summary files.
- Step 3 is about component discovery (referencing CPI Section I).
- Step 4 involves reading todo/tickler files from paths in `aidentity_context.json`.
- Step 5 is the initial interaction with the user, providing a summary of actionable items.
